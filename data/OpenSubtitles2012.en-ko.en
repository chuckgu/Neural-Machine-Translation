The dream is always the same.
Instead of going home, I go to the neighbors'.
I ring, but nobody answers.
The door is open, so I go inside.
I look around, but no one seems to be there.
Then I hear the shower running.
So, I go upstairs to see what's what.
Then I see her.
This... girl!
This incredible girl!
I don't know why she's there because she doesn't live there... ... but it's a dream, so I go with it.
"Who's there?" she says.
"Joel," I say.
"What are you doing here?"
"I don't know.
"What are you doing here?"
"I'm taking a shower," she says.
Then I give her... ..."Do you want me to go?"
"No," she says.
"I want you to wash my back."
I'm getting enthusiastic about this dream.
So, I go to her, but she's hard to find through all the steam.
I keep losing her.
Finally, I get to the door...
... and I find myself in a room full of kids taking their College Boards.
I'm over three hours late!
I've got two minutes to take the whole test.
I've just made a terrible mistake.
I'll never get to college.
My life is ruined.
Here's the game:
Five-card draw with a spit. Anaconda, high-low.
Pass two to the right, one to the left...
What happened?
Last night?
That's right, with Kessler.
She was babysitting down the street.
We know that!
So, I went over there.
She was giving the kid a bath and accidentally hit the shower thing.
All of her clothes were drying upstairs.
So, she plops down on the kitchen floor... ...she looks up at me and says... ..."I think I'm in the mood."
She said that?
What did you say?
I didn't have to say anything.
What did you do?
What do you think I did?
I think you got the hell out of there, ran home and whacked off!
I disagree.
Did you have your bike there?
I think you jumped on your bike, pedaled home and whacked off! That's what you think, right?
With Kessler sitting on the floor like that, wanting me?
No guts, Goodson.
The problem was I just wasn't attracted to her.
That should never stop you.
She seemed too big.
It could've worked out.
I thought I'd get into trouble.
Sometimes you have to say, "What the fuck!" Make your move!
That's easy for you to say.
You're all set. You're probably going to Harvard.
Me, I don't want to make a mistake, jeopardize my future!
Joel, let me tell you something.
Every now and then, say, "What the fuck."
"What the fuck," gives you freedom.
Freedom brings opportunity.
Opportunity makes your future.
Be right there.
So, your folks are going out of town?
Tomorrow.
You've got the place all to yourself?
Yeah?
"What the fuck."
If you can't say it... ...you can't do it.
Joel, did you get your SAT scores?
How did you do?
597: Math, 560: Verbal.
If you wanted to, you could take them again?
- I guess so. - Great.
Joel, I want to show you something.
Honey, did you pack my Mace?
Yes, in your cosmetic case.
Joel, do you hear something odd?
Something unpleasant?
No.
A preponderance of bass, perhaps?
No.
Is this the way I left the equalizer?
No.
This is not a toy for you and your friends.
If you can't use it properly, you're not to use it at all.
My house, my rules.
Joel, I spoke to Bill Rutherford.
He interviews for Princeton.
I'll never get into Princeton!
I already arranged an interview.
Friday night, the 4th, at our house.
Jesus, Dad!
Tell him about your involvement with Future Enterprisers.
They like that.
There's $50 for food, which is more than enough... ...another $50 for emergencies and an extra $25 just in case.
Don't forget to water the plants on the patio.
I made a list, it's on the refrigerator door.
Dad, should I start your car? The car will be fine, Joel.
For the battery, I mean.
Please, you're not to use my car. You're not insured for it.
- Use the station wagon.
- Use my car, honey.
Do we understand each other?
Okay!
As far as the house is concerned, just use your best judgment.
We trust you.
Have a great time.
Be good.
We will, honey. You too.
"Just take those old records off the shelf "I sit and listen to them by myself "Today's music ain't got the same soul
Guess what?
Dalby got into Harvard.
He must have aced his Boards.
780: Verbal.
765: Math!
Shit!
Do you know what a Harvard MBA makes, first year? $40,000.
My cousin went into dermatology.
First year, over $60,000!
Just for squeezing zits?
Why don't you try it, Barry? You have the experience.
Thank you, you're very kind.
Listen, you guys.
Doesn't anyone want to accomplish anything?
Or do we just want to make money?
Make money.
Just make money.
Make a lot of money.
What about you, Joel?
Serve my fellow mankind.
Profit motive.
Competition.
Free enterprise.
Is there any company that doesn't have a product in production?
We're falling far behind. You haven't exactly been helping.
You wanted to be the production executive. Bullshit!
Every sales manager I know helps with production.
Yeah? Who?
Everyone! Just help me with the production!
I can't! I'm too busy with marketing and sales!
How can you be busy with marketing and sales? I haven't given you the product yet!
Barry, just bring the goddamn thing over tonight.
I only did this because I thought it'd look good on my record.
Hi, Glenn. What's up?
- I heard your parents were away. - Yeah.
I thought maybe I could borrow a room?
Barry is here and we're working.
We won't bother you.
We don't have anywhere to go.
You know how it is.
Sure. Take my room.
Thanks, Joel.
Ready?
The "Memo-Minder"!
Here's how it works.
A call comes in for your mom, it's fairly important.
What do you do? You write the message down here, hit the switch... you've got the light.
Now, a call for your dad comes in and it's really important!
You're gonna get your ass kicked in if he misses it. So, what do you do?
Write the message down there, hit position two...
$1.86 in parts, sell it for $9.95 and make a fortune! I can't concentrate with this.
This is really annoying. It's ridiculous!
I'm out of here.
Lock the door when you leave, Glenn.
If you read me, grunt twice! Thank you!
I can't believe Glenn bringing Statwiler over like that.
Why? Because he boffed Hendricks last week!
He did? Yes!
And after the game on Saturday, he fucked her.
- Barry? - What?
Boffing and fucking are the same thing.
They are?
Yes. What did you think it was?
I thought it was something else.
You're sure on this?
I'm positive. Shit!
Sublime breasts. They're what kind of breasts?
Sublime breasts! A couple of boys in daddy's car.
Do you want to race?
Hit it.
Okay. Good.
You've done the old man's car bit. That's a good start.
Now, try this on for size.
"The Leather Castle.
"Chicago's finest dominants and submissives.
"Fully equipped dungeons. Beginners welcome."
It sounds great, Miles.
Here's one!
"My daddy used to spank my bare bottom.
"Now he's gone. Will you take his place?
"Call Misty." Come on, Joel.
You've got to take advantage of this!
They come to your house!
"Countess Angelique seeks young submissive with large ankles!"
This is it!
"For a good time in the privacy of your own home, call Jackie:
"555-4875."
Succinct, to the point, down to business. What do you say?
If you want to call, call for yourself.
A good time, Joel!
In the privacy of your own home!
What else can you ask for?
I'll make my own calls, thank you.
Then... ...call!
Forget it! Forget it!
All right!
I'm calling.
You're calling?
Someday you'll thank me for this.
You'd better not mention me.
It's her answering machine.
Hi, Jackie, this is Joel Goodson, 345 Remson, Glencoe.
I'd like a good time in my home tonight. Bye!
That was really cute.
Now, give me the number so I can call her back.
Number? There's no number?
Give me the number, damn it!
There's no number.
You're an asshole!
Gotta go. Catch you later.
Shithead! Oh, God!
Hello, Joel. I'm Jackie.
How are you?
Nice to meet you, Jackie. I'm not Joel.
Joel stepped out for a moment.
I'll go call him.
Holy shit!
Dalby, get your ass over here!
I'm playing cards, Joel!
Just get over here!
Is she there?
Yes, she is here, and she is waiting for you!
She's not waiting for me, she's waiting for you.
Are you coming? No!
I'm playing cards!
You're not coming?
Get over here, Dalby!
Look, I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
Joel, be a courageous person. Open the door!
That way, you see, I can call a cab.
Again, I'm really sorry.
As long as we come to an arrangement, I'm in no mood for complaining.
I mean, when you put your good money down... ...you gotta get what you wanted in the first place.
When you buy a TV, you don't buy Sony if you want RCA.
I know we could get along real well. But, hey!
It's your hard-earned money, right?
This way, we make an arrangement and everyone is satisfied.
You had carfare.
A long ride. I don't ever come out this far.
And your time.
My time, my effort, my infinite patience and understanding.
Thank you. $75.
Fair enough.
Joel, I'm going to give you a number.
You ask for Lana.
- It's what you want. - Thank you.
It's what every white boy off the lake wants. All right, Goodson, we know you're in there!
What's that?
I think someone's out there. Joel, the house is surrounded.
Do exactly as we say, and no one gets hurt.
Oh, shit!
Get off the babysitter!
Put on your pants, and come out with your hands up!
Please, Joel, do as they say!
Get off the babysitter!
Don't throw your life away like this.
Listen, you goddamn punk, you'll never have a future!
Not if I can help it!
You got that? No future!
Who is that?
My father! Hello?
Lana?
Yes?
Hi.
I'm a nice guy, and I'd like to meet you tonight.
Fine. Where are you?
Where do you live?
Glencoe.
What's your name?
Ralph.
Ralph, can I have the address?
345... ...Remson.
Ralph?
I'll see you tonight. Are you ready for me, Ralph?
This is a beautiful place, Ralph. Is it all yours?
It's my folks', actually.
Do you know what it's worth?
A lot, probably.
Oh, yeah! Real estate?
It's fabulous!
Look, Lana... my name really isn't Ralph. It's Joel.
I need $300... Joel.
You're kidding?
No, I don't believe I am.
Can I send it to you?
Can you send it to me, Joel?
I just don't have that much here in the house.
How much do you have?
- I have $50. - $50?
What are we going to do about this?
I have a bond at the bank I could cash... I'm not good at waiting for people.
I'll be quick.
Give it a try. I'm back!
I'm here for you.
How could she? It's so stupid!
Tell your mother it broke! That egg is worth a lot more than $300!
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna get it back, is what I'm gonna do.
Are you going to help? Sure. When?
Right now!
I can't do it right now! I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow!
Hey, "Mr. What-The-Fuck"... ...what about "exploring the dark side" and all that?
Or was that just bullshit?
That was just bullshit, Joel.
I'm surprised you listened to me. Are you coming?
How can you even tell if she'll be here?
I called Jackie and she said to try here.
Great idea. Where else could we get a hot chocolate for $4?
She's here!
Where?
The blue dress... those legs...
That's her.
She's fantastic!
She's looking right at us! She knows we're here.
That's it?
That's it, Joel?
I can't believe we came all the way here for that!
At least she knows we're on to her, Miles.
Yeah, she must be terrified.
Joel!
Is this your car?
Maybe.
Could we talk a minute?
Okay.
Let's talk!
Okay. In the car, all right? It's freezing.
Will you do me a favor?
You want me to do you a favor?
I just need a lift.
Look, I want my egg back!
Get out of the car! Joel, better get moving.
I want my egg back!
You got it, all right? Just start driving! When?
- Now! - Open the door!
When do I get it back? Start driving!
Open the door! Are you going to open the door?
Hey, buster!
Fuck! Will you just...
- Get off the car! - Just start driving!
Start driving, now!
Why don't you start the car, Joel?
Fuck! Get out of here!
Start the goddamn car, Joel!
Lana, open the door.
Where are you going? Lana! Get out, or I'll kill you!
Who was that guy?
My manager.
He gets a little crazy sometimes.
This is my friend, Miles.
Do you like excitement, Miles?
Love it.
Okay, where do you want to go?
I don't know, Joel. I haven't given it a lot of thought.
Tell me this:
Am I going in the right direction? Oh, shit!
Here he comes!
Here who comes?
That manager guy?
Hey, Guido!
Big man, Guido!
Big man with a gun!
What are you going to do?
Shoot us all? Stupid!
This guy Guido... ...he's a "manager"?
Or a pimp?
Now, that's quick, Joel.
Have you always been this quick, or is this something new?
I don't believe this! I have a trig.
Mid-term tomorrow... ...and I'm being chased by Guido, The Killer Pimp!
Miles?
I think I can take him.
What are you talking... I'm really not enjoying this.
I think I'm going to throw up.
I think I'm going to throw up on you, Joel!
Porsche... ...there is no substitute.
Fuck you. Hi, dear.
It's Mother.
How are you?
Just checking in to say hello, see how you're doing... ...and give you our flight information.
Wait a minute. Let me write this down.
Saturday, United, Flight 162 at 3:30. That's right.
How's everything else? Do you have enough money?
It never seems to go as far as you think it will.
Yes, I know.
I'm learning, Mom.
How is Aunt Tudi?
I will.
See you then, bye.
Your folks?
So, how are they?
Oh, they're just great.
How about Aunt Tudi?
Her hip is much better. She sends her love.
You were telling me about Guido.
I quit Guido.
How come?
He thought he owned me.
Nobody owns me.
The problem is, I owe him for clothes and hospital bills.
You were in the hospital?
I had this... ...pain in my chest.
I thought it was a heart condition.
What was it?
The doctor said nerves.
Nice service.
Reed & Barton.
Thank you for breakfast. It was good.
I'm going to school now.
I'll have to ask you to leave.
I'm sorry.
You won't let me stay?
No, I have to go to school.
I'm really sorry.
No, I'm sorry. I'll be right back.
You guys go ahead without me.
She's still here?
She won't leave. She won't leave.
Lana, look... ...I just want my egg back.
I have a lot of work to do.
Did you have a good time last night?
You mean when we got back here?
I think you know what I mean.
I had a great time.
Don't tell me I owe you another $300.
Did I say you owe me anything?
No, you didn't.
I don't remember saying you owe me anything.
What about my mother's egg?
You're the one who's going to college, you figure it out.
How much time do you need?
I need long enough to make a few phone calls.
I have to figure out how to get my stuff back.
Guido has probably locked me out of the apartment by now.
All right!
But will you do me a favor?
Anything, cookie.
Don't steal anything!
If I come back here, and find anything missing... ...I'm going straight to the police.
Joel, go to school. Go learn something.
May I see your pass, please!
I'm sure you've all read chapters six through eight... ...so here's a little pop quiz to confirm it.
Will you put your books on the floor, please?
You didn't tell anyone, did you? No. Glenn knows.
What about Barry?
He knows, too.
Don't tell anyone!
I won't! I won't!
Lab reports should be on my desk by tomorrow afternoon.
I won't accept any that aren't typed. Term papers are due on Friday.
They count for 50% of this semester's grades.
Damn it!
Hey, Miles, what's going on?
I'm waiting for Glenn.
Glenn? Where is he?
Inside.
In the house?
He wanted to meet her!
What are you doing? I was inside.
I can see that. You're home now.
Yeah, I live here, remember?
Glenn?
Tell me you didn't do anything with her.
Who, Lana?
Yeah, Lana.
Nothing. I met her. She's nice.
You're sure you didn't do anything?
Yeah, I swear.
You did it with her, didn't you, Glenn?
I did not do it with her, Joel!
Ask me about Vicki! Who is Vicki?
Owe you one!
Are you Joel? Nice place you have here.
Where's Lana? In the den.
I like your friend!
Get out! I'm not kidding!
What's your problem?
Just leave! Please!
Look, we're not ripping you off or anything.
What is this for? Fifty goes to the house!
You're the house!
I am not the house! Just leave!
I mean it!
He's mad, Vicki.
Already? I just got here!
I think he wants us to go.
Do you want us to go? Thank you.
I don't want any problems.
Do you know what you did to me last night?
I don't care!
I don't want to see you or do anything with you anymore.
Get in the car!
Excuse me.
What can I do for you?
Who are you?
Are you the kid I chased last night?
Is there something I can help you with?
You shouldn't drive like that.
People get hurt all the time.
Are you a smart kid?
You look like a smart kid.
I'm okay. Where are the girls?
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.
The door is locked.
You're starting to give me a stomachache.
Good! I hope it hurts!
Are you going to open the door?
Guido, go home! We don't need you anymore!
Shut your mouth!
Listen, maybe we don't work for you anymore!
Then who do you work for?
Who? If you don't work for me?
Maybe we work for Joel, now.
She's only kidding.
I hope so.
Joel, you look like a smart kid.
I'm going to tell you something I'm sure you'll understand.
You're having fun now, right?
Right, Joel? The time of your life.
In a sluggish economy, never, ever fuck with another man's livelihood!
If you're smart, like I hope you are...
...you aren't going to make me come back here. Thank you, Joel.
It's very decent of you.
Just as long as we understand each other.
One night, then you'll find another place to stay.
As soon as we get in touch with Tandy, we'll have a place.
- Did you try her again? - She's still out.
And my mother's egg?
If I can get my stuff back, I can get the egg.
Then you'll leave? Then we'll leave.
I don't know, Lana. He has such nice friends.
Clean, polite, quick.
I think there's a future here.
What are you studying?
It's a workshop... ...on free enterprise.
We make a product, and then we try to market it.
Do you make a lot of money?
No. Not really.
No, but we... ...get to compete with other student companies.
Actually, it's fucked!
I'm just kidding.
It's really quite competitive.
Do you ever get high, Joel?
Yeah. All the time.
You see, Vicki and I were thinking about getting high.
Maybe going out and getting some ice cream?
You want to come?
I could go for some ice cream right now.
Are you stoned?
No. I do not believe so.
I think you're really wasted!
This is not wasted, Barry.
This is definitely not wasted. Barry?
- I'm a little wasted! - I know.
- Don't let me do anything stupid. - Don't worry.
Want to take a walk?
How do you like living at home?
It's okay.
I'll be out next year.
I'll bet your folks are nice.
They're gone till Sunday?
Yeah.
Because, I was thinking...
I mean, after your friend came over... ...I couldn't believe it!
A kid our age walks in with a $100!
Glenn.
Where did he get that kind of change?
I don't know.
He said he cashed a bond.
You people have a lot of bonds.
So, I was thinking... ...if we ever got our friends together, we'd make a fortune!
Yeah. You're right.
Do you want to do that?
Do what?
Get our friends together in the next few days.
No. I don't think so.
Make some money. Be a little enterpriser.
Future enterpriser.
Be whatever you want to be.
What if I said I'd be your girlfriend for the next few nights?
No charge?
Hey, I'm not pushing you on the idea.
It's just that my mind keeps working all the time.
Nothing I can do about it. It keeps working and working.
You warm enough?
I'm okay.
How come you left home?
Why?
I was just wondering.
Because my step-father kept coming on to me.
What else do you want to know?
Do you have any brothers and sisters?
I have a brother.
What else?
If you don't want to talk...
No, no. Ask me anything. I don't think you want to talk and it's okay.
No, I really want to talk to you.
What does he do?
He's in school.
How come you're not in school?
I'm not my brother.
I'm really trying to be friends with you.
But I'd appreciate it if you'd stop trying to judge me... ...while you're leaning on your daddy's $40,000 car.
I'll see you around.
Was it something I said? You locked the door!
The keys are inside the car! Please!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Please stop!
Please stop! Thank you.
Thank you.
All right, everyone watch your feet!
Are you okay?
Do you want an aspirin?
Does your dad own a gun?
Who's the U-boat commander?
You're right. You are absolutely right to respond this way.
I did not have a doctor's appointment.
But I will tell you exactly what happened.
"Unexcused." You see, Nurse Bolan... ...lf you write "unexcused," I fail two mid-terms.
It'll wreck my whole grade point average!
If you'd just stop and listen to me, I'll explain everything.
The truth is, my parents are away, and I met this girl.
A call girl, actually. She came to my house.
Look, you're writing again!
This is not "unexcused"!
If you will just listen to me, then you'll understand, Nurse Bolan.
Why? Why won't you listen to me?
I had a doctor's appointment.
Excuse me.
It wasn't the girl, it was my father's car.
I put my father's car into Lake Michigan... ...and I had to get it fixed.
Just give me a break.
Let me put it this way.
I have spent the last four years of my life busting my butt in this shithole!
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can leave until I get just a little compassion from you.
What did he get?
Suspension, five days.
They kicked him out of Future Enterprisers, too.
Shit! They trashed his whole record!
What's he going to do about the car?
Are you okay, Joel?
I'm okay.
I need a bike.
He needs a bike.
- Glenn, can I borrow your bike?
- Jesus, Glenn! Sure. Here, use mine.
It was great the way her mind worked:
No guilt, no doubts, no fear.
None of my specialties.
Just this shameless pursuit of immediate material gratification.
What a capitalist!
She told me I could make more money in one night than I'd make all year.
Enough to pay for my father's car.
She told me she'd be my girlfriend.
She told me a lot of things.
I believed them all.
So, she introduced me to her friends. "Now when I was a young boy
"At the age of five
"I have lots of fun "I'm a man"
I introduced her to my friends.
We made Barry our treasurer.
Lana did production.
I concentrated on sales.
So, you took her out to dinner twice.
What did that cost you?
About $30. With tip?
Okay, maybe $35.
Any movies?
Three movies. $20.
Parking? I park on the street.
Gas?
Maybe $6.
All right, Stan, you're in for roughly $60. What happened?
She slept with Jacobsen.
That's all I'm saying.
Do you know what he said... afterwards?
He said the lady had knowledge.
He was glad to get that knowledge.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because college girls can smell ignorance... ...like dog shit.
I'll think about it.
Where are you going to school next year? Wisconsin.
Wisconsin?
Big school.
All I'm saying is... ...walk like a man.
Joel! This is a great party!
Are you having a good time?
Excellent idea, Joel! Really excellent.
Some of the girls are wearing my mother's clothing.
What's wrong with that? I don't want to spend the rest of my life in analysis.
- Just talk to them, okay? - All right. Is Howie Rifkin here?
You're on, honey.
Joel! Somebody is at the front door for you.
All right, thank you. I'll be right there.
The thing is... ...I don't have to pay for it.
I get it anyway.
I'm going to get going or I'll miss the party.
Whatever you want to do... Excuse me.
Can I help you?
Are you Joel?
Yes. Bill Rutherford, Princeton Admissions.
I believe we had an interview scheduled.
If this is inconvenient for you... No, sir.
It's fine.
Is it okay if I have the room?
Also, could you catch the phone if anyone calls, please?
I understand that you would like to attend Princeton.
Yes, sir, very much.
Well, fine.
Let's take a look at what we have, shall we?
Does this couch open?
Lana, I'm in a meeting.
We need the room.
I need a few minutes, okay?
Now, you've taken your SAT's already.
Math: 597, Verbal: 560.
Correct me if my information is inaccurate.
Well, yes, but I was planning on taking those again.
Fine. Now, your grade point average is 3.14.
You class rank:
52... ...which places you in the 84th percentile. Is that correct?
Joel, this is my cousin, Ruben, from Skokie.
Can you get him in tonight? Not now, okay?
- He has to be back by 12:00.
- All right, later guys. Excuse me.
And you wish to major in? Business.
Business. Yes.
I'll be out in a second.
Fine, well, let's see what else there is.
"Junior Varsity Tennis Team, Recording Secretary, Spanish Club... "...Varsity Track Team:
"...Honorable Mention:
Cook County Science Fair... "...Future Enterprisers, Yearbook Staff... "...Student Council:
You've done some very solid work here... ...but it isn't quite Ivy League, is it?
You know, Bill... ...there's one thing I've learned in all my years.
Sometimes you have to say, "What the fuck."
Make your move.
I beg your pardon?
So, how are we doing?
Looks like University of illinois! "All right, all right! "Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!
Some of your friends are looking for you.
What do you want me to tell them?
Has that guy from Princeton left yet?
No, he's still here. He's talking to some of the girls.
Talking?
They're very good talkers.
I don't think I'm going to say, "What the fuck" anymore.
This thing has gotten way out of control.
I'm going to kill Miles.
Oh, come on, Joel.
Look at it this way. You're making a lot of money.
You're providing your friends with an invaluable service.
God knows, they needed the service!
And, right now, you are one hot-shit future enterpriser.
Don't worry so much. I'll be upstairs.
And... you have a girlfriend to boot.
Do I?
Phone call for Joel.
Here, I'll get it.
Well, do I?
What do you think?
I don't know.
Yes? No? Maybe?
Yes.
No.
Maybe.
Joel!
Dad? Who answered the phone?
Just a friend, Dad.
Do I know her? Have you ever made love on a real train?
I don't think so.
He's got a girl.
Let's make love on a real train.
Joel, are you there?
I'm still here, Dad. How is Mom? Is everything all right?
Let's go. Did I hear others there?
Just a few friends, Dad. Sounds like a party.
A party?
Come on, let's be alone together.
I don't remember giving permission for a party, Joel.
Honey, can you hear me?
There's nothing wrong with having friends over.
Just use your best judgment. We trust you.
We're coming in on United, Flight 162 at 3:30.
"Trust."
Seems to me if there were any logic to our language... ..."trust" would be a four-letter word.
The evening worked out well. We had a good cash flow.
Rutherford made a few new friends.
He said he'd do his best for me.
Finally, it was time to close shop.
The girls were exhausted.
Lana was hungry. She wanted to go out for a bite.
She wanted to make love on a real train.
Who was I to say no?
"Can you feel it coming" I thought no one was going to be here.
Be patient. "Well, I remember "I remember - don't worry
Hi. They stole the goddamn house, Lana!
I'm not here right now.
But if you'll leave your name and number... ... I'll call you back as soon as possible.
They took everything! This is unbelievable!
My parents will be home in two hours, Lana, and they took fucking everything!
I don't know if you know anything about this... ... but you have to call me right away!
Look, you've really got to help me!
Time of your life, huh, kid?
Where's Lana? Maybe she's on the choo-choo.
I hear she's got this thing about choo-choos.
I want to know who took my stuff.
I took your stuff, Joel, are you kidding?
Then you listen to me, buster! You a-hole!
If I don't get my stuff back...
Shit! "A-hole?"
I want my furniture back, right now!
Now, you listen to me.
No, no! You listen to me!
Shit! This is getting boring.
Can I have my furniture back? Please?
You listen to me, you little fuck!
You not only took my two best girls... ...you call me names and insult me!
I'm sorry.
If I had any self-respect... ...it wouldn't just be the furniture... ...it would be your legs!
Your arms! Your head!
Do we understand each other?
Yes, we do.
No! Do we understand each other?
Yes, we understand each other.
Well, you're lucky in one respect.
What's that?
I like you, Joel.
Don't you know that?
What time is it?
It's 4:15.
I'll find a cab.
Something must have happened. Taxi!
Joel, do you like music?
This is beautiful equipment.
What do you say, $300... ...amps, speakers, the works?
It's a bargain, Joel.
If you go downtown anywhere, it'd cost you double that. All right!
The kid likes music!
How about some women's outfits?
You know, something for your mom? Should fit her okay.
Yes.
What? Yes, I'll buy it!
I didn't give you a price yet.
Can we get through this, please? $125.
That's it, you have everything.
Wait a minute.
What about this?
What's that?
Some glass, artsy-fartsy thing.
What have you got left, Joel? $40.
I don't think I can go $40 on the artsy-fartsy thing.
- What do you think, Vic? - He's only got $40.
I only have $40.
We go $340?
I'll spot you the $300.
You're good for it, right?
Certainly.
I think he is too.
Here! Catch!
To Joel!
Here's wishin' you good luck on your future as a businessman!
Because, God knows, you're going to need it! Don't, you'll break it!
That's good.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I'd put all the Chinese things together, and the Greek on a separate shelf.
I don't think you should mix centuries.
Mom! Dad! You're home!
Where were you?
I was here. We called from the airport!
I must have been out back watering.
I thought you were coming home tomorrow.
Sweetheart, I said the 5th.
No, you said the 6th. I wrote it down.
I'm sure I said the 5th.
Give me a hand with the luggage.
She said the 6th.
Joel? Yes, Mom?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
What happened to my egg?
What do you mean?
There's a crack in it!
You're kidding!
No, Joel, I'm not kidding.
There's a small crack, inside the egg.
What's wrong? My egg is ruined.
What happened?
I don't know. You don't know.
Mom, maybe it was there before.
I don't think so, Joel.
How could you let this happen?
I'm sorry.
This is so damned irresponsible of you!
We'll get another one. Joel will pay for it.
Sure, I'll pay for it.
Where will you get the money to pay for something like that?
I'm very disappointed in you.
She'll be all right. Why don't you put in some yard work?
Do you have something to tell me?
No... ...I don't think so.
I just got off the telephone with Bill Rutherford.
Apparently, you two had quite a meeting.
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."
What?
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."
His exact words!
That's unbelievable!
You're as good as in!
I knew you could do it!
Haven't I been telling you, sometimes you have to say:
"What the heck!" Take some chances.
You were so right.
You've made me very proud.
I was just thinking... ...where we might be ten years from now.
You know what I think?
I think we're both going to make it big!
I'm very optimistic! I mean it!
Can I ask you something?
Was our night together...
...just to set up... ...Vicki and Guido?
No.
You don't believe me, do you?
My name is Russell Bitterman. I'm from Wheaton High School.
Our product is a paper-towel holder that sells for $8.95.
We made a profit of $850 last semester.
I don't want you to get hurt.
My name is Evonne Williams. We sell decorative planters for $7.
We made a profit of $500 last semester.
Guess we won't see each other for awhile.
I know.
Are you going straight home now?
I don't know. Why?
It might be nice if we spent the evening together.
I'd really like that.
How much have you got on you?
How much have I got on me?
I've got $20. $20, Lana?
What are we going to do about this?
- Can I send it to you? - Can you send it to me?
'Cause I don't have that much here.
How about I write you a check?
Do you think I'd accept a check from you?
What am I, stupid?
I have a bond at the bank.
My name is Joel Goodson.
I deal in human fulfillment.
I grossed over $8,000 in one night.
The time of your life, huh, kid?
Sync by honeybunny ( crowd applauding )
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to be here.
I feel pretty good today.
You know why I feel good? 'cause I-- finally, I have the body that I want,
And that's a thing people really covet.
It's a hard thing to achieve, and I did.
And I'm gonna tell you how
To have exactly the body that you want.
You just have to want...
A shitty body.
That's all it is.
You have to want your own shitty,
Ugly... Disgusting body.
I don't, though, like being those things all the time.
I get really sweaty all the time.
I-- and that's also bad for sex,
'cause I just sweat--
I just rain sweat all over people.
Like, I'm like, "oh !"
And that's what I'm like when I have sex.
I go, "uhhh! "uhhh!
Uhhh !"
And I always see her and she's like, just--
Just sweat is pouring off my head and she's like,
"dude, you're limiting my enjoyment by a lot." ( crowd laughing )
N ) no.
Well, then you can call for an appointment.
The results from that test
Don't come in until tomorrow.
No, I have no way of knowing the results
Before they get here.
Yes?
I'm here to see Ben, Dr. Mitchell.
Okay, what time is your appointment
And what is your name?
My name's Louie c.K. And he said to be here around 2:00. "he said"?
The doctor doesn't make appointments.
Oh, well, see, I know him.
We-- I used to-- we went to high school together
And I talked to him on the phone.
He said that I could come by.
He didn't put your name in the book
And he didn't tell me, so you don't have an appointment.
Can you check with him?
He's with a patient.
Okay, well, I'll just wait and--
Sir, you don't have an appointment.
Yeah, no, I get that,
But can you just let me wait until he comes out and--
You can't just sit in here
If you don't have an appointment.
Do people, like, come here and steal medical treatment?
Do they steal it from you?
Is that what happens? 'cause why can't you just let me wait-- ( men ) so just keep up that regime
And you will start feeling better very soon.
Thanks, doctor. No problem.
Hey, Ben, how you doing?
You told me to come by, remember?
Do I know you?
( snickering ) uh...
Come through.
It's fine, Priscilla.
Louie c.K. Hey, listen, I didn't mean to
Jump ahead of that woman if she was waiting.
Don't worry, she's...
She's dying.
Yeah, no hope-- really sad.
She has cancer
From her vagina up to her eyeballs.
So I'm just squeezing her for a little extra insurance money
Man, that's not funny.
Oh, God, how are you?
I'm, uh--
I feel like shit.
Feel like shit?
Are you sure you feel like shit and not diarrhea? 'cause you look like diarrhea.
It looks like someone poured diarrhea
Into a face-shaped mold.
( chuckling ) could you stop? 'cause I really am-- I'm worried.
I don't know what's up with me.
Look up. Okay.
I know what's wrong with you. What?
Aids. ( cackling )
I can't believe you're a doctor.
Strip down to your underpants.
Let's take a look at you.
Let's take a look at you.
Jesus.
That is-- you don't need a doctor,
You need a time machine.
Did no one tell you that tits
Are meant to be on women, not men?
What is that? Come on, man.
( giggling ) this is a nightmare.
Get up here.
Oh, dear.
Okay.
Take a deep breath and hold it. ( inhaling )
So how do you feel, really?
Apart from the tumor I can hear in your lungs? ( cackling )
You're an asshole.
Strip all the way down.
Oh, God, Louie.
How can-- that is...
Really bad.
That's the worst penis I've ever seen in my life.
That is disgusting.
It's--
Oh, my God.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me,
Seeing that,
And my dad hung himself in front of me
Whilst masturbating.
But if I could take one of those things back,
It would be seeing that awful cock.
It looks like you've been getting a dog to suck it off,
But it chewed it like it thought it was
A horrible old blood-and-cum-filled shoe.
Nurse, can you come here a minute?
I'm serious.
That is the worst penis
Probably in the world.
Nurse?
Honestly, is that not the ugliest penis
You've ever seen in your life?
Yes, doctor, it's very ugly.
Very ugly, very ugly.
She's a nurse, so--
Stop it.
Come on, man.
What worries me is, if that's your penis and testicles,
What's your anus gonna be like?
But we're not gonna find that out.
We are gonna find out because I need to give you
A full rectal examination.
No, no, no way.
Yes way.
You're over 40, Louie, okay?
No more wanking around.
This could save your life.
Okay, all right. Come on.
Look, it's not very pleasant,
But it's necessary. Okay, all right.
Okay, and I'll be as gentle as I can. Thank you.
( groaning ) sorry.
Is that okay? Yeah, it's okay.
How about that?
Yeah, that's all right.
What about this?
Jesus Christ! What?
This is serious. What's wrong with you?
This is serious.
There's no way it's supposed to go in and out like that.
Well, it can do.
I'm a doctor. Yeah!
And it tells me that everything is fine up there.
Jesus.
Listen, I'm still going with aids,
But let's do some blood work and find out.
My days start poorly, 'cause of the shape I'm in.
Because now, also, I'm 42, so I'm getting-- I'm get--
I'm really on the decline.
There's never gonna be another year of my life
That was better than the year before.
That's never gonna happen again!
I've seen my best years.
And when I wake up in the morning,
I just-- I'm-- I just sit there and I'm like,
"oh..."
It's an awful way to start your day.
Every day starts with me, like, my eyes open
And I reload the program of misery.
I just open eyes,
Remember who I am,
What I'm like...
And I go, "ugh.
"I guess.
"I guess do it.
"I don't know.
I guess-- oh, my God."
Somebody called me an Indian giver recently.
I don't know if you've heard that expression
Since you were kids,
But I remember we used to call each other--
"Indian giver" is one of the most offensive things
You could ever-- because what it's meant to be
Is that someone gave you something
And then they changed their minds.
That makes you an Indian giver.
And we equate this to the indians
Because our feeling is that they gave us America,
And then they--
Well, they didn't take it back, certainly,
But they chang
Which is that we got here and the indians were like, "hi."
And we were like, "hey, can we have everything ?"
And they were like, "well, we don't know what 'have' means,
But enjoy all the things that you need, like we do."
So we start killing all of them.
And they were like, "oh, dude,
"could you not do that part where you kill all of us? 'cause that's kind of a drag for us."
And we're like, "you guys are Indian givers! "oh, my God! "we're gonna name that after you.
You guys are dicks !"
Anyway, thanks a lot, folks, good night. ( applauding )
We're gonna keep this show going,
We're gonna bring the next comic up.
Very funny guy, you guys might know him.
Nick DiPaolo. ( cheering ) Whoa!
How about a hand for the emcee, going through chemo, huh?
All right.
Poor prick-- skinny, no hair.
How are you?
Welcome to the basement of al-qaeda's hideout and...
You think I'm kidding?
Those aren't Irish guys making your falafel
In the kitchen upstairs.
How's it going? It's a shitty night tonight.
I have two tables, all black people,
So I know I'm not making no tips.
Are you being serious right now?
Yeah, look over there.
I have two tables, they're all black.
I'm working for free tonight.
No, I mean, are you being seriously that racist?
What?
You don't know that they're not gonna tip you.
Yes, I do.
Just 'cause they're black?
I've been waiting tables for five years,
I never got a tip from a black person, not once.
First of all, I don't believe you.
Second of all, that's still racist.
I am not racist.
Screw you.
What are you talking about?
She says black people don't tip.
Are you nuts?
Niggas don't tip.
Everyone knows that.
Have you ever waited tables before?
No.
Then shut up, asshole.
I'm getting old.
This is how I know I'm getting old.
I actually pulled a muscle in my neck
Giving my wife the finger behind her back. ( laughing )
That's a true story.
We're having a fight, she walked out of the kitchen,
I went-- Ahh!
Like that.
Weird things are happening to my body as I get older.
Ever hold a piss so long it turns into a shit?
That didn't happen when I was in high school. .
Ooh, listen to that silence, huh?
Holy shit, I hit you right in
The "white guilt" muscle, didn't I?
I mean, can we quit calling Obama
The first black president?
My nipples are darker than Barack Obama.
They're so in love with this guy.
They want to give him his own national holiday, Barack?
He hasn't even been shot yet. ( crowd ) ooh...
This is perfect, they hate my guts.
All right.
People are such hypocrites down there.
I'm sure you did better at the Hitler youth rally.
Ha-ha, liberal fag.
Yeah, okay, himmler.
Why don't you just go eat out Obama's asshole? I would.
I mean, I'm not gay, but just to be part of history.
Country's going to shit.
You know, you Republicans are such babies.
You've had your way for eight years,
Why can't you just give somebody else a try?
Because it's a bullshit sham, that's why.
He's in there because of white guilt
And affirmative action.
And anybody who has the balls to say that out loud
Is called a nazi by deluded assholes like you.
Poor little nazis don't like being called nazis.
I'm sorry.
Can you guys stop having this conversation?
You know, when bush was in office,
Every time you put on the news,
All you saw was black people, gays, liberals
Just pissing and moaning at how bad he was.
Nobody-- but now Obama's in there, no one can say shit.
You know, if it's like you say it is
And it's your turn, then how--
Why don't we get a say in it, like you did?
I mean, a white guy doesn't have a voice
In this country anymore.
Are we supposed to feel sorry for white guys?
What, is 10,000 years of unchecked prosperity,
That's not enough for you?
No, it's not, give me 20.
Well, how about 30? Yeah.
And then you can celebrate with a big parade of soldiers
And have white columns with an eagle,
Maybe some red banners with a white circle
And have something like this going in the middle of it? The nazi thing again?
Is that all you got? Yeah, well, that's what-- it's the same thing--
What is it, what? It's one group--
Come up with a different argument. ...
Get what they want over everyone else.
Over, over--
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you? What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
You pretend you're kidding, but you really mean it.
My father fought those nazis, okay?
So if you call me that again,
I'm gonna punch you in the face!
All right, I won't call you that,
You Hitler nazi piece of shit!
( bleep )
Come on. Get off me!
Get the ( bleep ) off me!
You cut my hand.
Goddamnit.
Nice.
Jeez, man, it looks bad.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it? ( woman on loudspeaker ) dr. Green, telephone, please.
How long they gonna make you wait?
I ink the guy they're working on now
Has a musket wound.
Got blindsided by a model t.
I heard he got stepped on by a dinosaur.
At least you got that dirty jizz rag there
Seeping germs into your wound.
I think I saw the bartender spit into it
And wipe up some aids vomit.
God.
So how are the kids? Good.
They're at my place.
Babysitter.
They'll be waking me up in about four hours.
Must be nice. ( cell phone ringing )
Oh, it's andie.
Hello, hey, babe.
Yeah, no.
I'm out.
Nothing.
Yeah, no, try to get some sleep.
All right, you too.
Bye.
You didn't tell her where you are?
She's gonna start worrying, what's the use?
Must be nice having somebody at home worrying for you.
You got your kids.
Yeah, but a wife.
I mean, I just think it's great that you and andie
Made it work, you know?
You've been together, what, 15 years?
Yeah, well, it ain't easy.
Well, at least you did it.
Miss your wife?
No, but I envy you.
The other day, I get a package in the mail, right?
It's from India.
I'm like, what the hell's this shit?
So I open it up.
It's a brick of Viagra.
I look over at andie, she's grinning.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, she ordered on-line, you know.
I feel bad, she's lonely.
She's gorgeous,
I don't want to be with anybody else,
But, you know, some nights...
I don't know.
I'd just rather have a burger and hit the sack.
Yeah, we started counseling
And every other night
I stick a wooden medicated boner in her
And now just-- we sit around waiting to see
Who's gonna die first.
That's about it. Jesus Christ, Nick.
I mean, we're getting old, Lou.
I mean, we can't have kids anymore.
Um... I don't know.
At one point, one of us is gonna leave the other behind. ( sighing )
Oh, jeez.
I guess this is where the letter "c"
Comes for her dialysis. ( laughing )
Sorry about your hand, man.
It's all right, I don't jerk off anymore
And I can lift the toilet seat with the other one.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I called you a nazi.
Don't worry about it, faggot.
Uh...
Hey, seriously, man.
You got your kids, you're lucky.
I'm happy for you, really.
Thanks, Nick.
Remember when we were in our 20s,
We used to come home this late
'cause we were out getting laid?
We never got laid. ( laughing )
( Louie ) I remember one time I was with a friend of mine
Who lives in New York also,
And we went to go pick up his cousin--
She lives on a farm in new Hampshire her whole life.
Her family is this weird family that kept her kids on a farm.
Anyway, her parents finally died, so she got to leave,
And so she came down to visit her cousin,
My friend in the city,
And so we picked her up at port authority bus station.
She had never been to any city before
And we're picking her up at the port authority,
That smelly hole of a place.
And we pick her up there and she's just freaking out
At New York.
She's never seen anything like it.
And we pass this homeless guy and she sees him--
I mean, we all passed him, but she saw him.
She's the only one who actually saw him.
We didn't-- me and her cousin were like, "so? "he's supposed to be there. "so what? "there's a perfectly good reason why that's not me and it's him.
The right people always win, I'm sure of it."
But, so there he is,
And this dude was particularly homeless.
He was one of those high-octane homeless,
Smelly, just piss smell,
The unbelievable piss smell, just--
He was piss.
He didn't just smell like piss, he was--
When you piss, he comes out.
That's what-- that's how much...
I don't know if he had gathered it for warmth
Or folks just went, "ek," all day. ( crowd laughing )
And he had dreadlocks.
Not hacky sack, cool-guy, medical-marijuana dreadlocks,
Just "human-neglect clumps" of hair.
A clump of hair for every year
That no one knew his name or cared.
Yeah, that's who you've been laughing at
For the last ten minutes.
That's how bad it was.
And again, me and my friend were just like, "hmph."
His cousin immediately just gets--
She's like, "oh, my God !"
She takes a knee.
That's how-- I mean, I'm not even taking a real knee now,
That's how little I give a shit about the guy.
He's not even here and I'm still like,
"hmph, yeah, that's close enough."
She goes, "oh, my God, sir, are you okay?
What happened ?" "what happened ?"
America happened.
What do you mean, "what happened ?"
So she's down there-- "sir, can we call someone ?"
And me and my friend, we're from New York,
This is the crazy part, we immediately go to her,
"oh, no, no, no, honey, don't..."
We start correcting her behavior
Like she's doing something wrong.
She's like, "why, is he okay ?" "no, no, he needs you desperately,
"that's not the point. "we just don't do that here.
You silly country girl." ( crowd laughing )
Hello?
Louie? Hi, it's doctor Ben.
Hey, what's up man?
Yeah, yeah, how are you? Um...
Look...
I got back your blood work.
Yeah?
Yeah, listen. I'm sorry about being an arse...
By the way, um...
Te thing is I need you to come back here to do some more tests.
What... What for?
Well, your blood work shows... that... you may have... slight... big fat... gingi-ugly-itis...
Oh, my God, you're such a dick.
No, um, you've got AlDS.
That's why I thought I need prove, but don't worry, the cancer is gonna eventually kill the AlDS before... it kills you quite slowly and... and painfully.
No, no...
You do have cancer, though.
Loads of it. In your scrotum.
Um, in fact, that's all there is in the scrotum.
No balls at all, just two healthy lumps of cancer replaced the horrible *** bollocks in there.
And that's gonna... kill you as well, so um...
By the way, the AlDS shows um, this very... extensive shows that you... got the AlDS from raping a little blind boy...
Louie...

- What is he talking about? - Get the cages open.
No! No! No!
Listen, you sick bastard, we're taking your torture victims with us.
We'll get you out of here.
The animals are contagious. The infection is in their blood and saliva.
One bite...
Stop... Stop!
You've no idea! (screaming)
Get it off!
Help me! Get it off!
Get it off!
- What's the matter with her? - You have to kill her!
(screams) Oh, my God!
- What's the matter with her? - We have to kill her now!
Oh, God... (screaming) (sharp intake of breath) Hello?
(coughs) Hello?
(louder) Hello!
(belches) Hello?
Hello!
(alarm) Hello?
Hello?
(noises from behind door) (gasping and retching)
Father?
Father, are you OK?
Oh, shouldn't have done that.
Shouldn't have done that.
Shit!
(man) Over here!
- Over here!
- Come on! Go, go, go!
Keep going!
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up! - Covered everything.
- Who are those people?
Let's go! Let's go! - What the fuck is going on?
- Just move! Come on!
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe. They each get pissed.
The giraffe falls over.
The man goes to leave and the barman says "Oi! You can't leave that lying there."
He says "No, it's not a lion. It's a giraffe".
He's completely humourless.
You two should get on like a house on fire.
So who are you?
You're from the hospital.
- Are you a doctor? - He's not a doctor.
He's a patient.
I'm a bicycle courier.
I was riding a package from Farringdon to Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.
Then I wake up today in hospital. I wake up and I'm... I'm hallucinating or I'm...
What's your name?
Jim.
I'm Mark. This is Selena.
OK, Jim.
I've got some bad news.
It started as rioting, and right from the beginning you knew this was different.
Because it was happening in small villages, market towns.
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.
It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows.
It was a virus.
An infection.
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.
It was the blood.
There was something in the blood.
By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.
The infection was everywhere.
The army blockades were overrun.
And that's when the exodus started.
The day before broadcasting stopped, there were reports of Infection in Paris and New York.
We didn't hear anything more after that.
- What's the government doing? - There's no government.
Of course there's a government!
There's always a government. They're in a bunker or a plane...
No, there's no government, no police, no army.
No TV, no radio, no electricity.
You're the first uninfected person we've seen in six days.
Where's your family?
They're dead.
Like Selena's.
Yours will be dead too.
Look, I have to find them. They live in Deptford.
I can walk it.
OK? You'll go and come back, yeah?
- You won't.
- Yes!
No one ever comes back.
So lesson one.
You never go anywhere alone unless you've got no choice.
Lesson two.
Only travel during daylight. Unless you've got no choice.
We'll take you tomorrow.
We'll all go and find your dead parents together, OK?
Eat.
If you want her to slow down, you'll have to say.
- If there's anyone... - I understand.
- Anyone...
- I understand! OK. (sniffs)
Wait!
They died peacefully. You should be grateful.
I'm not grateful.
My... parents and my sister, we went to Paddington Station, hoping maybe we could get on a plane, maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.
I remember my dad had all this cash, even though cash was completely useless.
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.
Crowd was surging.
I lost my grip on my sister's hand.
I remember the ground was soft.
I looked down and I was standing on all these people.
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...
Somewhere in the crowd there were Infected.
It spread fast.
No one could run. All you could do was climb.
Climb over more people. So I did that.
I climbed.
And I got up on top of this kiosk.
Looking down, you couldn't tell which faces were infected and which weren't.
Then I saw my dad. Not my mum or my sister.
My dad.
His face...
Selena's right. You should be grateful.
We don't have time to get back to the shop before dark. We should stay here tonight.
My room's up at the top. You two can have that.
No, we'll all sleep in the same room.
It's safer. (radio) Jim.
- You're back.
- Yeah. - How was it?
- Fine.
Give me a drink of that, will ya?
- It's empty.
- Ha! Here.
I'll start working on them, then.
Mark! Mark! Selena!
(Selena) It's clear.
- That's Mr Bridges. - Were you bitten?
And his daughter.
From four doors down.
- Were you bitten?
- No.
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?
No. Mark?
Wait...
(Mark screams) Get that cleaned off.
Do you have any clothes here?
Um... I...
Yes. Then get them and get dressed. We have to leave now.
More Infected will be coming.
They always do. (Jim) How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?
- The blood. - There was blood on me.
It was on you.
I didn't know he was infected. He knew. I could see it in his face.
If someone gets infected, you've about 20 seconds to kill them.
It might be your brother, your sister or your oldest friend. It makes no difference.
Just so you know where you stand, if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.
He was full of plans. Have you got any plans, Jim?
Do you want us to find a cure and save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?
Plans are pointless.
Staying alive's as good as it gets.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's that?
Let's go.
What is it about tower blocks and shopping trolleys?
Stop talking. It's a long way up.
(Selena) Do you need a break?
- You?
- No.
Now I do need a break.
What's up?
Nothin'.
I got a headache.
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.
- Why didn't you say something before? - I didn't think you'd give a shit.
You've got no fat on you and all you've had to eat is sugar.
So you're crashing.
There isn't a lot we can do about that except pump you full of painkillers and give you more sugar.
As for sugar,
Pepsi or Lilt?
Do you have any Tango?
Actually, I did have a can of Tango somewhere.
(screech)
Quiet! That's an Infected.
Oh no, they're in.
Move!
Wait up, Selena!
Wait for me, please!
Please, Selena!
Please! - Wait for me!
- Come on!
- Run!
- Wait!
Please! For fuck's sake!
- Selena! - (screams)
Down the corridor. Flat 157.
Move!
Thank you.
Thank you. Open the door!
Open the door!
- Open up! - Where's Dad?
What?
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?
Let them in, Hannah.
Let them inside. Go in.
Go in!
("Frosty the Snowman") So, I'm Frank, anyway.
Jim. - Selena. - Selena.
Good to meet you. This is my daughter Hannah.
Come on, sweetheart.
Say hello.
Come on.
So...
This is great.
Just great.
Calls for a celebration, I'd say.
Why don't you all sit down and...
Hannah, what have we got to offer?
We've got Mum's crème de menthe.
Great. Crème de menthe.
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.
Get comfortable.
- (Frank) Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.
Nah, the good ones. It's a celebration.
Top cupboard.
So this is your place?
It's nice.
There.
I know it isn't much but, well, cheers.
Cheers.
(groans) You OK in there, Jim?
Yeah.
Sorry we couldn't spare the water. Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.
You'll have to use the bucket.
Have to empty it each morning.
Just chuck it over the balcony. No mod cons here.
It's fine.
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.
We have a spare room.
In there.
Are you and Selena...?
No. No, no, no. Um...
I'll take the living room.
It's fine.
Right.
No, I mean, yeah.
So, um...
- Goodnight, then. - Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.
Very spruce.
- Very shredded.
- Yeah. - So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.
Probably need us more than we need them.
I think they're good people.
- Good people?
- Yeah.
You should be more concerned about whether they're gonna slow you down.
- Because if they slowed you down... - I'd leave them behind.
- In a heartbeat.
- Yeah.
I wouldn't.
Then you're gonna wind up getting yourself killed.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
Selena...
You think I don't get it, but I do get it.
And I know I'd be dead already if I hadn't met you.
Sure.
No, look...
I mean, thank you.
And I mean, sure.
Goodnight, Jim.
Goodnight.
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.
I thought we'd be OK with the water from the other flats.
Cisterns and tanks.
But it vanishes so quick you wouldn't believe.
You drink it, it evaporates, turns stagnant.
They're all empty.
Hasn't rained in ten days.
You can set up a plastic sheet to catch dew and condensation.
Saw it on TV once, but I can't make it work.
You'd never think it.
Needing rain so badly.
Not in fucking England!
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.
(man on radio) Salvation is here. The answer to Infection is here.
If you can hear this, you're not alone.
There are others like you. There are other survivors.
We are soldiers and we are armed.
Oh, my God. Soldiers.
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602, 27 miles northeast of Manchester.
- You must find us. Salvation is... - Now it just repeats.
- It's a recording? - Yeah, it's a recording.
But this is where it's telling us to go.
Just there.
The way things are, we might need two or three days to get up there.
"We"?
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah do need you more than you need us.
- Look, I didn't...
- No, it's OK.
It's the truth.
I can't leave the block if it's the two of us.
Something might happen to me. Hannah'd be alone.
I couldn't risk it.
But with other people...
If it's a recording, the soldiers who made it could be dead.
- It's possible. - That stuff about the answer to Infection...
There is no answer! It's already done all the damage it can!
- Maybe they have a cure. - Maybe they've got nothing.
- The only way to find out is to reach them. - We could die trying, Frank!
Or die here.
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said. You need us just the same as we need you.
We need each other.
And we'll never be safe in the cities. The soldiers could keep us safe.
So we have to try and get there.
Get there how?
Just so you know, I don't take cheques or credit cards.
- (Frank) What do you think? - It's the most direct route.
Then we should take the indirect route. The one in daylight and not underground.
(Frank) Let's just get it done.
(Jim) No, no.
No. See, this is a really shit idea.
You know why? Because it's obviously a shit idea.
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel full of fucking smashed cars...
It's really fucking obviously a shit idea!
Hold on!
Dad!
(screaming and laughing) Fuck!
The world's worst place to get a flat.
Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.
I've got the wheel.
You're on the jack. Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?
Hear what?
(Hannah) Right, I've done it.
Dad?
(scrabbling sounds)
- Jesus Christ! - (Hannah screaming)
Fucking rats!
They're running from the Infected.
Move it!
Forget the jack, Hannah. There's no time. Just lift, everyone.
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!
Lift, lift!
- (Selena) Don't look at them! Don't look! - (Jim) I can see them!
They're coming! (screeching)
Come on, Hannah!
Almost.
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- I'm trying.
Three, two, one, drop it!
- Get in the car!
- Come on!
- Frank, drive! - Move it, Frank!
(Jim) Whoo! Goodbye, you fuckers!
Frank, stop the cab.
Let's shop.
(Frank making engine noises)
You...
You...
You... (Jim) Anybody seen any buns?
Hmm.
Irradiated.
Don't take anything that needs to be cooked, OK?
I think you can eat that raw.
Decaffeinated coffee...
Put that back.
Can't just take any crap.
If I never see another chocolate bar again, it'll be too soon.
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!
Now, single malt, 16-year-old, dark, full flavour.
Warm but not aggressive.
- (Hannah and Selena laughing) - Peaty aftertaste.
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.
Either we do this now or we're walking.
Not you.
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?
You heard.
Where are you going?
We've got enough food, Jim.
We don't have any cheeseburgers.
(quietly) Like going on holidays with your aunt!
Oh, Jesus. Hello?
I hate you!
Find anything?
- Find anything, Jim? - No! Let's get outta here.
OK, we're done here.
OK, Hannah.
Easy.
Brake!
Brake, brake!
Out.
(Selena) Mmmm!
Oh my God!
I can, like, taste the vitamin C.
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.
What did you say?
The raisins. They're so moist.
Look over here.
Like a family.
(Hannah) Do you think they're infected?
(Frank) No.
They're doing just fine.
Come on. Let's eat!
Know what I was thinking?
That you'll never hear another piece of original music again.
You'll never read a book that hasn't already been written, or see a film that hasn't already been shot.
Um... that's what you were thinking.
No.
I was thinking I was wrong.
About what?
All the death.
All this shit.
It doesn't really mean anything to Frank and Hannah because...
Well, she's got her dad and he's got his daughter.
So... Cheeky monkey!
I was wrong when I said staying alive is as good as it gets.
See, that's what I was thinking.
Was it? Mm.
You stole my thought.
Sorry.
That's OK.
You can keep it.
It's getting late. We'd better stay here for the night.
I can't sleep.
Me neither.
Doesn't feel safe, does it?
Outside like this.
I think we're safe enough.
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.
Yeah, I noticed that.
Hey, Selena...
What? What is it?
How'd you get to sleep?
Bloody hell. Must've needed a hell of a prescription for that lot.
I didn't need a prescription. I qualified as a chemist.
Oh, great.
Valium.
Not only will we be able to get to sleep but if we're attacked in the middle of the night, we won't even care.
- Two each. - Not for me, thanks.
Can I, Dad?
I don't think so, sweetheart.
Please?
- No. - I can't sleep.
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.
- Give her half of one. - All right.
We're on. Night-night.
You're a big softie, Frank.
Frank? Hannah? Frank?
Hello?
Hello!
Hello!
Hello! Hello!
(mumbles) Shh...
You're having a bad dream, that's all.
Thanks, Dad.
(car horn)
Come on, sleepyhead.
Come on, Babe Ruth.
(Frank) Hurry up.
- Did I miss breakfast? - (Selena) You'll sleep through anything.
- (Jim) Did you have a fry-up? - (Frank) We'll stop at a pub on the way.
Door! (radio) Our location is the 42nd blockade, the M602, 27 miles northeast of Manchester.
You must find us.
Please!
Salvation is here.
The answer to Infection is here.
Must be Manchester.
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.
No fire crews to put it out.
42nd blockade.
This is it.
I don't understand, Dad. Did they leave?
- I don't like this. I think we should go.
- No! Vehicles.
We should check the vehicles. There has to be something.
Nothing.
I can't believe it.
Frank... Frank!
- We have to go.
- Yeah.
Go fucking where?!
(cawing) Get out of it.
Get out of it!
Dad, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.
Sorry I lost my temper.
Hannah...
I love you very much.
- What? - Keep away from me.
Stay where you are.
- Dad? - Keep away from me! Keep away from me!
Keep away! Keep away!
Keep away!
- Dad! - Keep away! Keep away!
(Hannah) What's wrong?
Dad! Jim!
Jim, he's infected!
- No! - Now, Jim!
Now!
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!
Kill him!
Stay away from him!
Keep away from the body!
Dad?
(man) Three survivors. One male, two female.
I repeat, one male, two female.
ETA, 15.
Put the kettle on.
I'm Major Henry West.
- Welcome. - Jim.
Hello, Jim. Hello.
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets and a boiler that produces hot water.
So you can all have a shower.
You look like you need one.
Please. It ain't funny.
I got loads of cooking to do, you fucking Doris!
Run him over!
(Jim) How is she doing?
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.
It's all fucked.
What do you mean?
Oh, don't do that. Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, don't do that.
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough, strong, and she'll cope just like I'll cope.
- Just like you'll cope. - I don't want her to have to fucking cope.
I want her to be OK.
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.
It was OK for them and it was OK for us.
Now it's all just fucked.
So you heard our broadcast?
- Yeah, we did. - We must be a disappointment.
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army base with helicopters and a field hospital.
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to Infection.
Yeah.
As I said before, it's here. Though it may not be quite what you imagined.
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.
The fire drove hundreds of Infected out of Manchester.
The surrounding area's teeming with them.
But don't worry.
You're quite safe here.
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights which we've rigged up to a generator.
High perimeter wall which helps.
And we've been lacing the ground with tripwires and land mines.
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn, but if they get in, we hear them.
Secondary to protection, our real job is to rebuild.
Start again.
The belly of the house.
The heart.
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot water. The first step towards civilisation.
The kitchen.
Here you are.
I'll swap you.
- Now don't be throwing it. - Here, give us some.
Don't be fighting. Will you put that back?
Put it back.
Jones, our resident tin opener.
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.
I can't wait.
And lastly, meet Mailer.
Mailer, Jim.
Jim, Mailer.
Got infected two days ago.
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold and we got a chain round his neck.
Keeping him alive?
The idea was to learn something about Infection.
Have him teach me.
And has he?
In a way.
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.
Farm crops, raise livestock.
He's telling me he's futureless.
And eventually he'll tell me how long the Infected take to starve to death.
(singing) ?
You'll have to wait and see ? Hope it's chips, it's chips ?
We hope it's chips, it's chips
(cheering) Hat.
So, what have we here?
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...
- (man) Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!
- It's a feast, Jones. - Honour of our guests.
Absolutely.
I was going to propose a toast but this omelette will do just as well.
- To new friends. - (all) New friends.
Jones, did you notice while cooking that these eggs were off?
I thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.
Get rid of it.
(man) Doris, you twat.
I don't suppose you can cook, can you?
I can't tell you how badly we need someone with a little flair in the kitchen.
What a fucking disappointment. I saw those eggs, I thought it was Christmas.
We'll have eggs again. Once everything's back to normal.
You muppet! Look at him, eh?
He's still waiting for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.
- You don't know nothing. - I think Bill's got a point.
If you look at the whole life of the planet, we... you know, Man has only been around for a few blinks of an eye.
So if the infection wipes us all out, that is a return to normality.
- That what you meant, Bill? - Yeah, yeah.
Have you met our New Age sergeant?
Our spiritual guru.
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why did you join the army in the first place?
This is what I've seen in the four weeks since Infection.
People killing people.
Which is what I saw in the four weeks before Infection, the four weeks before that...
As far back as I care to remember, people killing people.
Which to my mind puts us in a state of normality now.
- You're not eating? - I don't want to eat.
You must eat, Hannah.
I don't want to eat. I want to bury my dad.
He's one of the people you're talking about.
(explosion)
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Move!
Move! Move!
Move! (siren) Enemy in front!
Mick, I fucking got one!
What do you want, a fucking sweetie? Keep shooting, you cunt!
Fucking hell! He bounced!
Cease fire!
I ain't never seen that in my life!
- Report clear! - Fucking hell!
- Clear.
- Clear.
Yeah, yeah, clear.
Oh, hello!
(wolf whistle)
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't gonna be needing this any more.
Cos you got me to protect you now.
You wanna get your hands on a really big chopper, you just come and see me.
Fuck you!
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.
How about right now?
Mitchell!
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go picking a fight with me, son.
Sergeant Farrell!
- Mitchell, first action on. - Resecure the perimeter.
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.
Slow down.
- Sergeant? - Sir.
Clear the bodies off the lawn.
The rest of you, go with him.
My apologies.
Drink?
Look, we're grateful, OK?
We're very grateful for your protection but if we're gonna stay here...
- Who have you killed?
- No one.
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive now if you hadn't killed somebody.
I killed...
I killed a boy.
A child?
Yes.
But you had to. Otherwise he'd have killed you.
Survival.
I understand.
I promised them women.
What?
Eight days ago I found Jones with his gun in his mouth.
He said he was going to kill himself because there was no future.
What could I say to him?
We fight off the Infected or we wait until they starve to death and then what?
What do nine men do except wait to die themselves?
I moved us from the blockade, I set the radio broadcasting and I promised them women.
Because women mean a future.
Selena! Hannah!
- What is it? - We have to go.
- Jim, wait! - No time!
Come on! Come on!
We get in the car and we go!
No! You're not going to keep them here! You've got to let them go!
You can't keep them here! Stay where you are!
I'm not gonna let you keep them here!
You can't do this!
Right, get him!
I want to give you a chance.
You can be with us.
But I can't let them go.
OK, Jim?
OK. Him too.
(Farrell) Smithers says "Women and semen don't mix."
And Mr Burns says "We all know what you think, Smithers."
And that was my favourite joke in The Simpsons.
That's what they're doing a few hundred miles away, across the Channel, across the Atlantic.
Eating dinner and watching the fucking Simpsons!
They're sleeping in their beds next to their wives.
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator because the OC has gone insane!
Starting the world again when the rest of the world hasn't even stopped.
Just imagine, just think about it.
How could Infection cross the oceans?
How could it cross the mountains and the rivers? It can be stopped.
Right now TVs are playing and planes are flying and the rest of the world is continuing as fucking normal.
Think! Actually think about it.
What would you do with a diseased little island?
They quarantined us.
"There is no Infection. It's just people killing people." He's insane!
Time to go.
Quarantine?
- Please... - Believe me, I'm not interested.
You see, I'm gonna have the black one. And I'm gonna make her squirm.
Mitchell, I swear to God it's gonna end badly for you.
Move.
Come on, move!
Get up!
Get up, you cunt!
Fucking move!
Get up!
Move your fucking arse!
(Farrell) Come on then, you fucking pansies.
Do me first.
(Jones) No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.
- (Farrell) So you're gonna stick me? - (Jones) Shoot 'em!
- (Mitchell) Why? - Because it's fucking quicker!
(Farrell) Is that how you'd let your sergeant go out, Jones?
- I'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.
You'll let him stick me? Like a fucking dog?
I'm gonna enjoy this.
You stupid cunt! What are you doing? You wanna shoot me?
- You wanna shoot me? I'll kill you! - Where's he fucking gone?
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!
- Jones, move it! - I can see him!
I can see him!
Where are you?
- Can you see him? - Through there!
(gunfire) Oh no.
We're fucked.
We're fucked!
Relax.
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.
And no shooter.
He's dead.
(thunder) (West) The first thing we're going to do is make you look more presentable.
The lady of the house has an extensive wardrobe which she certainly has no use for.
You can't do it to Hannah.
Go to the master bedroom, pick out a wide selection.
Yes, sir.
(Hannah) No...
(man) Ladies...
- It's only dressing up! - No!
Selena!
- I thought girls liked dressing up. - Expensive dresses.
(Hannah) Selena!
Whoa, whoa, relax!
Selena!
Selena! Selena!
You need to leave me alone with Hannah.
OK?
- Listen, right.
The OC wants... - He wants us to dress up nice.
If you want us to get changed, you have to leave the room.
OK? It's just polite.
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK? Come on.
Eat these.
Are you trying to kill me?
No, sweetheart.
I'm making you not care.
OK?
What you doing?!
(siren)
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim! Move!
Stay here and put the dresses on.
Let's go!
Go! He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.
Davis?
(engine fails)
Fuck it!
(gunfire) - What was that?
- Lightning.
I heard something.
It sounded like a Claymore to me.
All right, I'll go and hit the floods, take a butcher's.
Girls, keep an eye on him, will ya?
Those pills,
I think they're having an effect.
I can feel them.
And...
I don't feel sleepy.
But...
They've been a long time.
What are you gonna do if they don't come back?
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?
Is that the way it works?
Shut up.
I don't think they are coming back. I think they've been killed.
- I said shut up! - Hannah...
They're dead.
And you're gonna be next.
- Get up! - Whoa!
We're gonna get out of here. Stay with it, Hannah.
Don't worry. I feel fine.
Really.
Get him off me!
Get him off me!
It's Jones!
It's Jones! Oi!
Where the fuck are you going? What's all the fucking shouting about?
(screaming) Don't just stand there, you soppy cunt!
Get after them!
You two, in there!
Move! (wheezing) Come on, then!
What the fuck you gonna do now?
(screaming) Come on up! Col!
- Defend these stairs with your fucking life!
- Hannah!
- Mailer's loose.
- Hannah! (screech) (screeching and wheezing)
Sorry...
- Sir... - Shh. Shh.
Hannah?
(screech) Hannah? Selena?
I haven't got any bullets. I haven't got any fucking bullets!
Don't fucking leave me!
Come on!
Move!
Move! Move!
It's just you and me now, darlin'. But don't worry, I'll get you out of here.
Then we'll find a nice little fucking place somewhere.
Just you and me.
And we'll live happy ever after, eh?
(screaming) That was longer than a heartbeat.
Jim?
Listen. Listen. It's not all fucked.
We're gonna be OK. It's not all fucked.
- I've got to explain something.
- Shut up.
It's gonna be OK.
Hannah, it's OK! He's not infected.
But I thought he was biting you.
I was kissing her. Are you stoned? - It's a long story.
- (screeching)
We have to get out of here.
Come on! Come on!
Move!
You killed all my boys.
Wait...
Hannah!
Hannah?
Hannah! Hannah! Get in.
They're locked.
The gates are locked!
Fucking do it!
Come on, Jim, breathe!
Fucking breathe! Not the curtains as well.
(man speaking on radio) You looked all right in this, you know.
It's coming!
- You definitely heard it?
- Yeah!
- I can't hear anything! - I told you, I heard it!
(distant aircraft) Go.
Do you think he saw us this time?
Julisa ... Julisa ...
Aure ...
Julisa
Aurelio?
Julisa
Aurelio? Estado hacienda aqui?
Why didn't you come to bed?
Julisa... ay eme
Back it up and set a perimeter
No one within five hundred feet!
Quiet calm of this Coral Gables neighborhood was shattered early this morning by...
Want a cup of coffee, H?
No, thank you
That smells good
A little caf?cubano
Put some hair on your chest
Don't you just say the sweetest things
That stuff's no good for you
It'll rot your stomach out
It is believed that the bomb squad
- ... is inside this house right now - Is it serious?
Change the channel
It's not known if anyone else is in the house or if...
Live on the scene of a bomb scare... .. bomb in a Coral Gables...
County Dade Bomb squad...
I didn't know they made body armor in triple extra-large
They make jockey that size but you wouldn't know anything about that either
Horatio Caine
Back from the dead
Found any good fiber lately?
Just enough to keep me regular
What do we have here?
Schedule-80 PVC collar clamped around the vic's neck
Going to have to "John Wayne" it
That's not the way you taught us, Big Man
I don't have much choice
Can't do remote
Got to be hands-on Best hands in the business
Look, I gota go do this thing but let's grab a beer later Catch up
I-I keep my insurance policies in a wall safe upstairs
It's good to know
I keep mine in a sock drawer
Would you tell my wife ... tell her I love her
You can tell her yourself in a couple of minutes
You two will be knocking back mojitos in no time
All right, we lost the family today
This is top priority
- Where's Horatio?
- Inside Have you talked to him?
Because, uh, I think he knew the guy
Yeah, Al Humphreys
He brought him onto the bomb squad, trained him
They were close
Give me a minute alone with him, okay?
Okay Thanks
Victim's name is, uh, Aurelio Moreno
He's a successful Coumbian importer
This is obviously the seat of detonation right here
The shattering effect here indicates high explosive and blast and frag pattern indicates that the explosive, uh, was packed up front
Everything above the neck is blown away
Below remains intact
Horatio, this isn't a great idea ...
Is everybody outside?
Yeah
You should stand down
Let us work this one
This is a crime scene like any other
We should at least wait for the M.E. to clear the bodies
What I need you to do is I need to get everybody in here right now to process this
I want every hair, nail, fiber and every ounce of Al's blood recovered
There are no other crime scenes in Miami today
Three types of damage here:
Frag from the container thermal effect from the release of gasses and blast pressure
Potentially the most damaging
Blast pressure forces air outward in a shock front of up to twenty-nine thousand feet per second
When did you ever work a bomb scene?
I happen to read books
Okay?
What does your book say ... about this?
Blast pressure has two phases: positive and negative
When the air is pushed outward it creates a vacuum in the center
So everything gets sucked back in
It also means that the components from this device are still in this room
They're in a thousand pieces, but we should find them
So, Calleigh, let's find out who had access to the house
Eric, we've got to find that ransom note
And Speed, you Megan and I will look for the bomb
Find the bomb, find the bomber
Bomber came in through an unlocked window in the maid's room
Yesterday was her regular day off
Means the bomber knew their routine
And Moreno's wife said he liked to stay up late and watch TV
My guess is he got jumped right in the middle of Letterman
"Top ten ways to get your head blown off."
I'm sorry, lieutenant.
I didn't mean ... it's okay
I also found some type of fabric on the frame
Let's get that to trace, all right?
Is this the note?
Yeah Note's got some flash burns, minimal blood spatter certainly readable
I mean, "this is a bomb deliver $50,000 ...
Fifty grand?
Did you see the size of that place?
He could've asked for ten times that
Let's get this to chemical processing
You got it, H
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine
Horatio, what are you doing?
I'm giving Al's wife his wedding ring back
That's evidence
I know that You can't just give it away
I'm not giving it away ...
I'm giving it back
Avulsive destruction of the face and frontal calvarium
Thermal damage of the epidermis at the edges of the defect
Thought I'd seen everything
I'm surprised he didn't take his head clean off
Yeah I rushed tox
Traces of chloroform in his system
That's how the bomber got the collar on him
You didn't know what hit you, did you, sugar?
Rest of him doesn't look too bad considering
Looks can be deceiving
My god ... what happened?
"White Butterfly" effect
Pressure can cause massive internal damage
Lungs burst
Other organs turn to soup
How's Horatio holding up?
Fine
At least that's what he's telling me
He told me he wanted to be down here for Al
For his post?
Yeah He said he could handle it
What did you say to him?
Told him I didn't need him down here
But I knew someone who did
We've missed you since you left the squad
Been too long, Felicia
Al was just saying ... we need to have you over for dinner sometime
I'd like that
He never wanted to talk about ...
you always know there's a possibility something could go wrong ...
Felicia, everything I am I owe to Al
Everything I know, he taught me
How do I tell them?
What do I say to them?
You know what, Felicia?
I don't want you to worry about it
I want you to let me handle it
This is for you
It's not here
Casing came back positive for TATP
Homemade explosive
Very sensitive
Wouldn't want to get the shakes
Not this guy, this guy's a pro
Well, he sure made a beauty:
Dummy switches, alternative power source, collapsing circuits
We are still missing a component
The action switch is not here
We covered that scene on our hands and knees
We got it all
Let me say it again, it's not here
Evidence just can't get up and walk out of the room
Yes, it can
On their boots
And there it goes
So let's get it back
Three engine companies responded to that bomb call
It was like a freeway through that house
And we're going to check them all
Any chance it's going to lead to anything?
You tell me
Electric photocell
Yeah
This is what killed Al
I'm sorry about that, H
Yeah, me too
Me too
Calleigh? Got something on the fabric?
Flanders mesh pattern
Machine-made.
Size ten 32-count pella linen
French lace.
Tres couteux - Tres bon - Hmm
- Hey - Hey
Our bomber's quite the clothes hound
He has expensive taste
If he is a he
A lot of women's clothing is made with french lace
Blouses, scarves...
Lingerie
What? I shop on Valentine's Day
How you doing on the note?
Great. I ran thin-layer chromatography on the ink
It's, uh, garden-variety laser printer and you can find them at any copy shop
Which made me realize I was barking up the wrong tree
You analyzed the paper
Exactly. It's bagasse pulp
It's a treeless paper made from sugar cane fiber
It's imported primarily from Colombia
Colombia
We need to find out if any local area stores sell this
There are four high-end stationary stores here in Dade County
All of them are sold out and they're awaiting a shipment from a Columbian import company that's owned by one Aurelio Moreno
And I did some other fact checking
There's been a string of necklace bomb cases just like this one inand around Bogota
The bombers stalk their victims for weeks get their routines down cold
They pick only high-profile targets
They're wealthy enough to pay the ransom
Just like Moreno
Where's that paper shipment now?
It's waiting in customs impound
Then I'm wondering who else might have had access to that paper
Charlie Berenger, Customs
Eric Delko, CSI
So my boys tell me you're looking for paper
Coded watermarks, actually
It's a design pressed into the liquid paper stock
It can tell us when a particular lot was manufactured
Is this, uh, is this a restricted area?
Sure
Doesn't mean there's no access though
Security guards, dock workers plus any number of federal inspectors through here on a regular basis
Any of them have it in for a guy named Aurelio Moreno?
Moreno?
That's a real piece of business
He's been investigated by the cargo cats
The who? Cargo cats
It's a name we have for ourselves on the counter-smuggling task force
You have a file on this guy?
Yeah, sure
Looks like Moreno was doing all right for himself
Better than all right
Nothing moved between South Florida and Colombia without going through him first
Who's this?
That's Moreno's wife
Lauriana
That's not his wife
Esposa number two
And you didn't know that?
Now in order for a bomb to do its job it needs three components
Power source it needs an action switch and it needs an explosive load
We wired in a photocell like the one we found melted into the fireman's boot
So Al followed a render-safe procedure and he drilled in in an attempt to disrupt the power source
Once the pipe was breached, the light hit the photocell closed the circuit
BOOM
What kind of person makes something like that?
Well, bombers are ego-driven
They make bombs to gain control, get revenge, sow terror
Some believe they've been betrayed by society
Or betrayed by someone they trusted
Our Moreno was a busy boy
He had one wife in Miami, the other in Bogota
Customs inspector at Port of Miami told me that wife number two ... came in a week ago.
High season Maybe they found out about each other
Sounds like motive
Yeah, maybe it's time to talk to the wives
I don't know anyone who would want to hurt him
He was hard-working, honest
Aurelio was a good man
He loved his family
My husband was very devoted to family
He traveled quite a bit but he hated to be away from us
If there was even a weekend he could get away he would come home
Of course he had to travel for business, but he hated it
He didn't like to be away from me
He never wanted to leave me
I miss him so much
You have no idea how much I miss him
I'm sorry for your loss
We're trying to figure out who did this
What's that?
I'd like to ... take a swab of your hand, if I may
It might help me identify the killer
Would that be all right?
Let me see your left hand
Would you mind if I took a hand swab?
I don't understand
What could be on my hand?
It's just to rule out any possibility of cross-contamination
If it will help
Beautiful blouse
Is that french lace?
So, old Aurelio's got it coming and going, huh?
Plus he got a two-for-one discount on clothing and jewelry
Where does he find the energy?
Okay, I'm going to go run these
I'll see you in a minute
Hey.
Take a look at this
His American's wife's hands were clean while Lauriana had trace elements of triacetone and triperoxide -TATP
This is our bomber
All your years on the bomb squad ... how many bombers were women?
This is my first
I've called the INS to see if we can hang on to her while her extradition papers come through
Horatio, stop
Listen to yourself
No, you listen to me
This woman is not going anywhere until I clear her
How can anyone go anywhere with you running roughshod over the evidence?
Can't you see this isn't about you finding out what happened to Al?
The day Sean died
The day Sean died, I was at his scene
Restaurant shooting
Girl killed by her boyfriend
I didn't realize that Sean had gone across the street to the boyfriend's apartment
He found him on the fourteenth floor balcony ready to jump
Sean tried to talk him down, like any good cop would do
Guy took him over the side
I saw them hit
Didn't know who it was at first
I worked that case
I insisted on it
I wanted to be there for him
I couldn't
Grief is grief; work is work
Don't confuse the two
You're thinking...
You're thinking that maybe I've missed something.
Well, did you notice Lauriana's hair and nails?
Acetone and peroxide
Base elements of TATP
Also of nail polish and hair dye
Those two women didn't bat an eye when they got on the elevator
I'm a woman, and I'm telling you they don't know each other
They probably had no idea the other exists
Excuse me
Horatio
Where are you?
We've got another bomb
Any closer and I might have to file a sexual harassment suit
Yes, but it wouldn't stick
We don't work together anymore
Why do I the feeling this isn't a social call?
Well, we have information on the first bomb that you need
You're going to have to render-safe in the dark
The device that killed Al had a photocell just like this
When light hits it, it detonates
Bill, would you dig out the tarp, please?
Who's the target?
Vic's name is Maura Burgos
High-end antiques dealer
She was in her kitchen when she got jumped
Woke up from a chloroform bouquet to a necklace bomb around her neck
Burgos?
Is she Columbian?
Hard to say Unless that's code for scared out of your mind
How did she contact the police?
Garage door opener
Neighbor called it in
That was quick thinking, Maura, flapping the garage door
Did you have the opener in your pocket?
My purse
It was on the table when I came to
Okay.
Now stay with me, Kat I'm going to walk you through it
I think this is a twin of the other device which means the explosives are packed up front and the safe arm will be on the victim's right side
Copy that. Approaching from the right
Now remember you have to keep her calm
Hey, Maura. You know any Stevie Wonder?
Hey, babe ... everything is all right, uptight out of sight
Sorry, I'm giving you dandruff
Keep singing darling
Everything is all right, uptight out of sight
So, let's follow along the seam and that's where the frag is largest
I'm trying
Housing's as smooth as a baby's butt
That's because he used silicone gel sanded and buffed with an electrostatic cloth
Trying to hide this sucker but he can't hide from us, can he, Maura?
Uptight, out of sight...
You need to stop as soon as you feel the pressure ease and before you hit dead space
Just a few zip-zips, Maura and we're out of here
Easier than a trip to the dentist
Stop the drill
Kat, now wait a second now
That's beginning to separate
I want you to shut that drill down.
It's a hoax
Damn thing's filled with sand
I'm bringing her out
No, you're not You're going to stay right there
Nobody moves
Kat, listen to me
There may be a secondary device
Let me get Maura out of here first
No-no-no! It could function in any number of ways!
Either of you moves, it could blow!
This isn't your handle anymore, Horatio
Am I in the path that you cleared?
Yellow brick road right under your feet
Maura, should these wires be sticking out of this clown?
Yes. There was a little balloon that broke off
Okay, Maura what I need you to do is take a very good look around the room and tell me if anything is different
No, I just ...
I don't know
It's okay
We're clear in here
Deep breaths
You're doing great
What did I tell you?
Mojito time
Hey, Bill?
Yeah, boss?
Let's bring out the E.C.M and let's get everybody away from this kid on the bike right now
You got it
Nice bike
- What is that?
That is cool
Electronic counter measure?
He's jamming every radio signal in the area
In case the bomber's trying to remote-detonate
Back in my day
I had the, uh sting ray with a banana seat and the racing slicks but that was a long time ago
What's your name?
Conner
You know, it is, um, it is a little big for you
Where's you get it?
The man said I could keep it if I brought the package to his friend
He said to wait for him here
I did something bad, didn't I?
No, you didn't, Conner
Everything's fine
Here's what I want you to do, though
I want you just sit tight and keep your eyes on me
Can you do that?
Good.
Now, I'm just going to take a look at your bike
Hey, you like chocolate?
How'd you know?
All kids like chocolate
Okay, now here's what we're going to do next, Conner
Very slowly ... in slow motion
I want you to get off your bike
Beautiful
Conner, good job
Now, just as slowly I want you to walk not run right to those police officers right there
Good job, Conner
A new robot?
Yeah, "Andros."
Tracks a little smoother than the old one
Conner, I'm going to comb your hair to see if the man who gave you the package
left anything on you, okay?
I know the Detective asked you already but can you remember anything about that man?
That's okay
I forget too
Especially when I'm scared
You found me my target?
Green is for go if this is the same type of device
Conner, did the man have light hair?
Yeah ... light brown
Kinda wavy
See? You did remember something
You're right on line, Bill
Right on line
Laser's on target
What's it going to do?
Little gizmo on top's called a "disrupter."
This of it as a water pistol only it fires nine hundred feet per second
Water doesn't compress, it shoots out like steel rebar
If we get lucky, we can take out this power source
Circuit interruptus
And if we don't?
And if we don't we're going to have a very large crime scene to process
Let's go
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!
All clear
Okay.
The thing I don't understand if the bomber's after the girl why plant a hoax in her house?
Calculate the distance between the house and the sign
Couple hundred feet?
I'd say five hundred feet and that's exactly where the bomb squad would place containment and command post and that's by the book, isn't it?
You're saying this guy knows procedure?
The victims were decoys. He's after the bomb squad
Well, the first bomb, ladies and gentlemen was designed to kill the victim and the bomb tech
Second bomb was a decoy to lure them in
And the third bomb was designed to blow them all to smithereens
All those little pieces
It's hard to believe they can be so deadly
Fourteen ounces of semtex brought down that plane over Lockerbie and that's smaller than a bag of coffee
Killed all 259 passengers eleven on the ground
And this is gonna bring us straight to the bomber so Speed, swab everything
Eric, concentrate on the switches.
They're not handmade so let's find out the manufacturer's specs the make and model of every item
And Calleigh let's work on the wiring
Let's look for any cuttings or tool markings that seem odd, okay?
And let's put a rush on this, people
It is my belief that the bomb squad is about to get another call
What are you going to do, boss?
I'm going to look for the signature
Every bomber has a signature
I'm going to find his
I can tell you it's light brown, auburn in reflectivity a fragment of three inches with an angle tip cut
Cortical cell is damaged, medulla, fractional
But none of that is going to give you a name
I can also tell you that your standing there is not going to grow a hair tag at the end of the sample
I need everybody in the layout room
You miss it, don't you?
Being on the front lines
The simple answer is no
I saw you out there
Why leave something you're good at?
You ever been in a horse race?
Life's enough of a gamble
Some horses run better in a harness and the science is my discipline
I'll see you in there
What do we know?
A couple of components were brand-name capacitors and switches but the relay base grommets were painted, not clear
- Looks that way Find out where they were sold, Speed?
No sweat, no saliva, no hand lotion
But there were traces of chlordane
Insecticide?
Banned insecticide
It's still in use in some coffee growing countries, but I don't have a manufacturer yet
Keep looking.
Calleigh?
All wire ends were straight-edged standard wire cutters. Nothing fancy.
It's a dead end
Afraid I've also got a dead end, literally
- Hair is human. Doesn't belong to our guy - How do you know without a skin tag?
Faint traces of silicone adhesive at the root
It came from a wig
French lace -- from the window at the Moreno house
It's also used on high-end toupees It gives a more natural look to the hairline
Lace on a rug
Well, shoot me if it comes to that
What did you find from the bomb?
Signature is shrink-wrapped wires
laid end to end ...
leads twisted into a counterclockwise direction but that, ladies and gentlemen is not the big deal with this guy
This guy is a show-off
How can you get that from a bomb?
Every twist of every wire is about him:
"Look at me. Look at how clever I am."
Still doesn't give us a name
Let's go back to the top He's been around bombs
Maybe he has a grudge
Wears a toupee
Out of necessity ... chemo?
Maybe he's had some close calls
Maybe he burned his head in some sort of explosion
That could account for the wig And he's making his bombs out of counterfeit parts
In some place with some
- ... heavy-duty insecticide - So, where do counterfeit parts and banned insecticide come together?
Both are illegal imports
And Moreno was importing goods from Colombia and so was Maura Burgos
And it has to go through where?
U.S. Customs
Let's go back to that impound warehouse
What do you got?
These are all the agents with access to the Moreno and Burgos files combined with warehouse access
Customs enforcement agent Charlie Berenger.
There it is
That's who Delko talked to - You know him?
- A long time ago Radio cars are on their way
Okay, be careful of that
He gets wind of it, he may set another device
We should stand down and wait for backup Horatio
This is not a good plan
He's killing my friends
And he's talking to me
I'm going in
Horatio?
Charlie B.
Horatio Caine
It's been a while
- Hey, nice work with the kid on the bike - Thank you
- Just a couple of old bomb techs talking, right, Charlie?
- Yeah 1998 was a raw deal for you when that bomb blew ... wasn't it?
You could have beaten that timer
I would've ... if I didn't have Humhreys screaming in my ear
Al made a big mistake with you, Charlie
He underestimated you, didn't he?
But now you're going to show them
You picked victims to mislead the squad
You made them think they were dealing with colombian bomb but all the while, you were setting them up
-All right, partner, you know what you're doing now?
- Yeah Attaboy.
All right. Go on now Watch yourself, now.
Be careful
And that last device?
A work of art, Charlie Collapsing parallel circuits
Michelangelo would've been envious
I've done the reconstruction, Charlie and Al should have never taken you off that squad
You were too good for that
I was
Yeah
Look where it got me
Everybody has a bad day
Today could be mine
Trying to take you down could get us both blown up couldn't it?
- You think I can't get out of this?
I couldn't find the safe-arming switch
Yeah, well, it's easy to miss
You want a second shot at it?
You know, if you're wrong ...
That's true
Freeze!
Turn around, Charlie
We're clear
Okay, get on the ground
Get him out of my sight
So ...
You worked the case and still cleared it
Guess I was wrong
You weren't wrong
I just got hung up on the wives
You recovered
You know what I'm going to miss most about Al?
Most people ...
Gentlemen
Most people ... make you earn their respect
And with Al, that's where you started
Coming in?
In a minute
Hey
Thank you
For what?
For knowing the difference
Felicia
- Lady Russell. - My dear Anne.
You look quite done for.
I came back as soon as I received your letter.
I had no idea the position was so ruinous.
Unfortunately, a person who's contracted debts must pay them.
- Even if he is a gentleman. - Was there no possibility of retrenchment?
Unfortunately, Father and Elizabeth could find no means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a manner simply not to be borne.
But I have, at last, persuaded Father to let out the house.
And if I can ensure that we live within our means somewhere less extravagant, then, in only a few years, we may be solvent again.
In a few years?
In any event, it is better than selling. At least one day I may hope to return.
And where are you to go in the meantime? Is it decided?
All my hopes were for a small house nearby, but Father and Elizabeth are settled upon Bath.
Lady Russell.
Dear neighbour, you've been in London, I hear.
Sir Walter. Elizabeth.
May I say how truly sorry I am that you must leave Kellynch.
We are blameless, Lady Russell, quite blameless.
Every sacrifice has been made, however painful.
We cut off all unnecessary charities at once, Lady Russell.
And even refrain from new furnishing the drawing room, which, as you know, Mama left the most frightful state.
And still it is a comfort to know we've done all we could.
Of course.
Ah, but here's Shepherd. He's promised us some news.
Is that his daughter with him?
Mrs Clay's husband passed away not long ago. She has returned to her father's house.
She's often with us, recently.
Lady Russell. Miss Anne.
Sir Walter, I have this very morning received an approach for the lease of Kellynch that I'm convinced must meet with your absolute approval.
An admiral, sir, recently retired and a native of this county desires to settle in this very part of the world.
- An admiral? - I should have much preferred a gentleman.
The navy has its uses, no doubt, but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it.
- Indeed, Sir Walter? - Yes.
It is, in two points, offensive to me.
The first is being the means of raising persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and second, you never see a naval man who is not most shockingly knocked about, exposed as they are to wind and weather till they're simply not fit to be seen.
Nevertheless, Sir Walter, the admiral has a very substantial fortune, and I have no doubt of him being a most responsible tenant.
And consider, Sir Walter, how he will look around and bless his good fortune to be in the home of a baronet of such a prominent and distinguished family.
Yes.
Then, with your permission, sir, I shall open negotiations with Admiral Croft.
- Croft? - Yes.
Are you acquainted with the gentleman, Miss Anne?
Yes. No, um...
That is to say, I'm familiar with his career.
I'm not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable by the tenant.
If you will excuse me, there's still much to do.
Good heavens, Anne.
- What is the matter with you? - Nothing. I assure you, I'm quite well.
Anne...
Who is Admiral Croft, and why did he cause you to be out of countenance so?
Anne.
Admiral Croft's wife is...
- Is... - Mrs Croft?
Indeed.
And Mrs Croft is the sister of Captain Frederick Wentworth.
Wentworth?
I see.
I see.
And to think that soon he may be walking through this house.
Anne, you know that your father thought it a most unsuitable match.
He would never have countenanced an alliance he deemed so degrading.
He was not alone, as I recall.
My dear...
To become engaged at 19, in the middle of a war, to a young naval officer who had no fortune and no expectations, you would, indeed, have been throwing yourself away.
And I should have been failing in my duty as your godmother if I did not counsel against it.
You were young, and it was entirely prudent to break off the understanding.
Prudent it may have been and yet,
Captain Wentworth has made his fortune in the war and is now extremely wealthy.
Has he written to you?
No, never a word.
I've only the newspapers for my authority.
Then... if his intentions towards you had been truly sincere, would he not have contacted you when his circumstances changed?
I do not blame you, nor myself for having been led by you.
But nevertheless,
I think very differently now from what I was persuaded to think eight years ago.
Oh, my dear Anne.
You are a good and beautiful young woman.
I promise you this, one day you will find someone to love you as you deserve.
I'm 27.
Before I forget, Shepherd, if you have no objection, I have a mind to engage your charming daughter as a companion to Elizabeth.
Oh, Sir Walter.
Well, I'm sure, sir, Penelope will be greatly honoured by such a distinction.
Then it is settled. She shall come with us to Bath tomorrow.
Is not Anne companion enough for Elizabeth?
Oh, but Anne is going to Uppercross.
I received a letter only this morning from sister Mary.
She is indisposed, again, and requires Anne to come and look after her.
And since nobody would want Anne in Bath,
I wrote back straightaway to say she should come as soon as she'd finished everything here.
Well...
All your hopes were for a small house nearby.
Do send our regards to the Musgroves.
Before you go, Anne, on no account must you forget to visit each house in the parish to take our leave.
Is he married?
I do not know that he is, and yet, so eligible a gentleman would surely by now have formed an attachment.
Will he bring his wife here?
And his children?
I only pray that I am spared any meeting.
I know my chance of happiness has passed forever, but to be reminded of it by his presence here would,
I'm certain, be more than my spirits could bear.
Who is that young lady, Mr Shepherd?
Oh, that is Miss Anne Elliot, Admiral, Sir Walter's middle daughter.
The only one with any sense.
A pity, then, that we did not make her acquaintance.
She is but half a mile away at Uppercross with her sister.
Oh, well then, we certainly shall make her acquaintance.
Is she married, Mr Shepherd?
Sadly no, ma'am. Nor, I think, at her age, is likely to be.
Well.
It is certainly roomier than a frigate.
Such a number of looking glasses. There's no getting away from oneself.
I think this room would do very well for Frederick.
Let us see if he comes.
Your brother seems dead set against the whole idea of Kellynch.
I fear Somerset has unpleasant memories for him.
There was once talk of an engagement to a girl in the county.
- There was? - Eight years ago or so.
We were in the East Indies at the time.
He's never spoken of it, but his heart was quite broken, I believe.
Well, well, well.
- Frederick engaged, who would have thought it? - Indeed.
- I sometimes wonder if he will ever settle down. - Hmm.
So, you are come, at last.
I'd begun to think I should never see you.
I am so ill
I can hardly speak.
In fact, I do not think I was ever so ill in my life as I have been all this morning.
I'm very unfit to be left alone, I'm sure.
Is Charles not here?
Charles would go out shooting, even though I told him I was ill.
And I have not seen a soul this whole, long morning.
Not one of the Musgroves has seen fit to come and see me even though Charles told them I was ill.
It did not suit, I suppose.
Oh, you will see them yet, I'm sure. It is still early.
Or, perhaps, if you feel well enough to attempt a short walk to the great house, we could call upon them.
We ought to wait till they call upon you.
They should know what is due to you as my sister.
I assure you I have not the smallest objection on that account.
Perhaps a little air would do me good.
But I really must eat something first, I'm quite starved.
Anne.
- Good heavens. How the girls are growing up. - Mmm-Hmm.
The Miss Musgroves have returned from their school in Exeter with all the usual accomplishments, and, of course, they now think of nothing but being fashionable and merry...
Dear Henrietta, Louisa.
Oh, Anne.
Here you are at last. Come, Mama cannot wait to see you.
And we have such exciting news.
Welcome to Uppercross, Miss Anne.
How pale and drawn you are.
We must fatten you up while you are here.
I myself have been very unwell.
And Sir Walter and Miss Elizabeth. Oh, how they shall miss you.
In any event, I'm very happy to be here and not in Bath.
Oh, Mama, I hope we shall be in Bath this winter.
But remember, if we do go, we must be in a good situation.
Oh, yes. None of your Queen's Squares for us.
- Anne, how are you? - Very well. Thank you, Charles.
- You're getting big. - I am glad to see you've recovered, my dear.
Did you ask your father? Did you, Charles?
Father has many other uses for his money and the right to spend it as he likes.
Charles, if it is left to you, we shall soon be destitute.
Admiral Croft and his wife are to take possession directly.
And I believe we have been very fortunate with our tenants.
Yet it must be very hard for you, my dear, to give up your home so.
Of course, when your poor dear Mama was alive, there was moderation and economy at Kellynch.
But there were never balls, and the Crofts are sure to have balls and invite the most eligible young naval officers.
Indeed, this is our exciting news, I quite forgot.
Mrs Croft, it appears, has a brother, Captain Wentworth, and he has just returned to England and is coming to stay with them at Kellynch.
It is true. The Pooles chanced to make their acquaintance in Taunton this week.
It is said Captain Wentworth is the most handsomest man in the navy and quite unattached.
- And has such a wealth of Spanish gold. - Indeed.
Well, we shall all see for ourselves when he comes to dine tomorrow night.
Oh, Papa.
I have just now received this note from Admiral Croft accepting my invitation.
Anne. Are you ready?
We must not keep the Crofts and Captain Wentworth waiting.
Charles. Charles.
Charles. Come directly. Charles.
He fell from a tree in the garden.
I've sent for the apothecary. He will be here directly.
His collarbone is dislocated.
Charles, look after Mary. We shall be all right.
Ready?
All done. With a little rest, he'll be right as rain in no time.
Oh, thank God.
And never fear, Charles, I shall give your excuses to the Crofts.
(STAMMERlNG) Excuses?
Indeed, with the child going on so well now, it would be a shame to spoil the dinner.
I am really most anxious to meet our new neighbours.
Indeed, it's more a duty than anything else.
(STAMMERlNG) If Anne will stay with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.
Of course.
And so we are to be left to shift for ourselves with a sick child, while you go to dinner with the Crofts.
Well, I need not stay too late, dearest.
Just because I'm the poor mother who is not allowed to stir, because he is going on so well.
He says... How does he know he is going on so well...
Please.
Please.
You may all leave little Charles to my care.
Well, this is very kind of you, Anne. Are you sure?
In any case, I've no appetite.
Well then, it is settled.
Oh, Anne, you missed the most delightful party last night.
I cannot tell you how handsome is Captain Wentworth.
He is so much more handsome and agreeable than anyone I have ever met before.
- Such manners, such conversation. - Such capital.
Oh, and we have all been invited to Kellynch tomorrow night for dinner.
Even you, Anne.
Damn it, Mary, I'm late. Is he here? Who?
Oh, Captain Wentworth, do... do come in.
Forgive me, I... The door was open.
I trust the boy does well?
- Oh, yes. - Much better, thank you, Wentworth.
Oh, Captain Wentworth, this is my elder sister Anne.
- We are acquainted. - Really? But Anne has never said a word about it.
It was a long time ago, you were away at school.
Come, Wentworth, or the birds will all have gone south for the winter.
Of course. Ladies.
Oh, come, Henrietta, let us go with them.
Wait, wait, wait for me.
The worst is over. I have seen him.
We have been once more in the same room.
A bow, a curtsy,
I heard his voice and then, he was gone.
He has not forgiven me.
I have used him ill, deserted and disappointed him.
And worse, I've shown a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident temper could not endure.
Once there were no two hearts so open, no feelings so in harmony, but now we are strangers.
Worse than strangers for we may never become acquainted.
It is perpetual estrangement.
And tonight, I'm to be tested once more.
Frederick. There you are. Let me introduce you to Miss Anne Elliot.
Miss Elliot, my brother, Captain Frederick Wentworth.
Captain Wentworth and I met briefly yesterday.
Oh, Frederick, you might have told me.
This must be very bad for you, Miss Elliot, to come to your home and find us here.
No, not at all, Admiral. I'm happy to know that the house is in such worthy and careful hands.
And what news, Frederick, of dear Captain Harville?
He's settled for now at Lyme with our good friend James Benwick
- who's awaiting a new command. - How exciting.
Of course. I remember Captain Benwick. He's engaged to Harville's sister.
I'm sorry to have to tell you that she died last summer while Benwick was out at the Cape.
- Oh, no. How dreadful. - Yes.
Five years they waited for a fortune to satisfy her family.
Now he has it, of course, but too late. Much too late.
But then I've never thought that a man on active service
- should even contemplate marriage. - Have you indeed?
A frigate at wartime is no place for a woman and the long separations are a sore trial to both parties.
Oh, how true. There is nothing so bad as a separation.
As I know to my cost, for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes and I'm so glad when he's safe home again.
But now I'm paid off and ashore, Sophy, you'll be delighted to hear that I'm, at last, resolved to settle down.
Indeed, Frederick, I'm delighted to hear it. Pray, do you have anyone in mind?
No, no, I'm quite ready to make a foolish match with any woman between 15 and 30.
A little beauty, a few smiles, and a compliment to the navy and I shall be lost.
Oh, come, Frederick.
After all, what right has a humble sailor to expect any better?
But if I am to speak in earnest, what I desire above all in a wife is firmness of character.
A woman who knows her own mind.
I cannot abide timidity or feebleness of purpose.
A weak spirit which is always open to persuasion, first one way and then the other, can never be relied upon.
Well, we must see what we can do.
Oh, Anne, play us something to dance to.
Yes, Anne, will you? Something jolly. - Oh, yes.
Do you know, I believe that I've never seen a pleasanter man in all my life than Captain Wentworth.
Hmm.
He was not very gallant by Anne, though, was he?
When Louisa asked him what he thought of you the other night he said you were so altered, he should not have known you again.
- I would not swear he used exactly those words. - Although he was most attentive to me.
It must be said he would make a capital match for Louisa.
(SHARPLY) Louisa. Stuff and nonsense, Charles. It is clear he is all for Henrietta.
But, my love, surely you cannot have forgotten that Henrietta has an understanding
- with my cousin, Charles Hayter. - Indeed, I have not.
But I cannot say the same of Henrietta.
(LAUGHlNG) And quite right, too.
For who, pray, is Charles Hayter? Nothing but a country curate.
What a degrading alliance for a connection of the Elliots.
Now, there you talk nonsense, my dear.
He will inherit the estate at Winthrop, and the farm near Taunton, and he is a very amiable young man.
Well, I do not think a young woman has the right to marry anyone, however amiable if he is disagreeable or inconvenient to her family.
No, no, what stuff.
If Henrietta has Charles Hayter and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth,
I shall be very well satisfied.
Well, what do you say, Anne? Does the Captain prefer Louisa or Henrietta?
Wentworth.
We're just going over to Winthrop to visit Cousin Charles, Henrietta's intended.
Why don't you come with us, Anne. I'm sure the Hayters would love to see you again.
Capital idea, Louisa, we shall all go.
I know Mary's in a fine sweat to see Cousin Charles again.
(GlGGLlNG) Catch me.
Anne.
It is nothing.
Thank you. I'm well.
It is really nothing.
But I think, perhaps, I'd better stay here and rest a little while.
- Then I shall remain with you. - No, please, I...
I would hate to inconvenience you and I... I know my way to Winthrop perfectly well.
I shall catch up with you directly.
Please, Charles.
Very well. If you insist.
(PANTlNG) Ah, see? There is Winthrop.
You had all better go on without me. I am really excessively tired.
It would be very rude of us to come all this way and not call on our cousins.
I will stay with Mary, Charles.
If you and Henrietta want to go on and pay our respects to the Hayters.
And I am sure Captain Wentworth will offer us his protection.
Very well.
Henrietta.
It is most unpleasant, having such connections, Captain Wentworth.
But I assure you, I have never been in that house above twice.
In my life.
I wonder where Anne has got to.
Mary is good-natured enough in many respects.
But she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense.
She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.
You know, we all wish Charles had married Anne instead.
- Anne? - Oh, yes.
- Did you not know he wanted to marry Anne? - No. I did not.
- Do you mean to say she refused him? - Oh, yes, certainly.
When did this happen?
I do not exactly know, but before he married Mary.
Did she say why she would not marry?
Well...
Papa always said it was her great friend Lady Russell's doing.
He thought Charles might not be bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and so she persuaded Anne to refuse him.
I myself would have no idea of being so easily persuaded.
When I have made up my mind, I have made it.
And I'm quite determined.
Yours is a character, I see, of decision and firmness.
And I honour it.
Oh, look. They have brought Charles Hayter with them. Come.
Ah. There you are.
We thought we might cross your wake if we drove out this way.
Admiral Croft, Mrs Croft.
We've just paid a visit to my cousin, Charles Hayter.
Oh.
Miss Elliot, you must be tired. Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home to Uppercross.
Oh, no, thank you, no. It is too much trouble.
Oh, no, we are returning in any case by that road and there's plenty of room.
- Really, you're too kind. Stuff, Miss Elliot.
- You must come with us, indeed you must. - Oh.
Walk on. - Thank you, Captain.
I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvas and bring home one of those two young ladies to Kellynch.
He means to have one of them. There's just no saying which one.
They're both very good-natured, unaffected girls, indeed.
They're a very respectable family. What do you think, Miss Elliot?
It won't be long, if I'm any judge.
Now I understand him.
He can never forgive me.
He condemns me still for the past and is becoming now quite attached to another.
And yet...
Anne. We are to go to Lyme tomorrow morning.
Captain Wentworth must visit his best friend,
Captain... Something or other.
And has invited us all to make the trip with him. Ain't it prime?
No, indeed, I'm sure I'd better stay here with the children.
(QUlVERlNG) Am I to go without you?
In my delicate state of recovery?
Suppose I were to be seized rather suddenly in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell for servants?
Quite attached to another.
And yet...
Still he cannot be unfeeling.
He cannot see me suffer without wishing to give relief, to spare the proof of his own good, warm and amiable heart, which I cannot contemplate without infinite pain and regret.
(LAUGHlNG) The sea.
- I love the sea. - I'm sure I love it more than you do.
Frederick.
Come on.
Captain Harry Harville, Captain James Benwick, Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove.
Miss Henrietta Musgrove, Miss Louisa Musgrove, Miss Elliot.
Miss Anne Elliot?
Yes.
Capital.
Oh, my God, the air.
Of course, the admiralty amuse themselves every now and then by sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed.
- It's true. - But they do have a great many...
Captain Benwick, may I say how sorry I was to hear of your terrible loss.
Thank you.
There never was a love like ours.
And never will be again.
There were a great many to provide for and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to distinguish which may be least missed.
(STAMMERlNG) And yet, Captain, you are still young, and I pray you may one day rally and be happy with another.
A man does not forget a woman as readily as you forget us.
I will not allow a woman's nature to be more unconstant than a man's.
And yet, you will allow that poetry and novels are against you.
They tell us endlessly of the fickleness of women.
And are they not all written by men?
Yes, Miss Elliot. Perhaps they are.
I see we shall not readily agree on this.
I would never suppose that true constancy is known only by women, but the one claim I shall make for my own sex is that we love longest when all hope is gone.
A toast. The navy.
The navy.
You did a good deed. Cheering up so with poor Benwick last night.
I've not known him talk so much.
Not in a long time.
In time, we found a common interest in poetry.
He reads nothing else. Day in, day out.
Never happier he is than when reading impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony or sundered hearts destroyed by wretchedness.
(LAUGHlNG) Yes.
I did venture to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study.
It's bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is.
But what can we do?
Well, he's young.
And time is a great healer.
Or so, at least, I'm told.
Oh.
- Forgive me. - Not at all.
Who is that gentleman?
Mr William Elliot, sir. Came in last night on his way to Bath for the winter.
William Elliot? Bless me, Anne, it must be our cousin William. It must, indeed.
He is handsome. He is not.
Did he mention a connection to the Elliots of Kellynch at all?
He certainly said he would one day be a baronet.
There. It is him, it is.
He seems of particular interest, this cousin?
Sir Walter has no sons, so his title and the estate of Kellynch will pass to the cousin.
What a pity we should not have been introduced to each other.
His father and Mr Elliot have not been on speaking terms since his unfortunate marriage.
An introduction would have hardly been welcome.
You'll hardly be able to avoid seeing each other in Bath.
You'll be sure to mention our seeing him next time you write to Father.
On the contrary.
Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?
- Captain Wentworth, catch me. - Louisa.
- Louisa. Louisa, no. Louisa, no.
Louisa.
Louisa.
A surgeon. A surgeon, quickly.
- Of course. - Captain Benwick.
Captain Benwick knows where one can be found.
Send him to the inn.
Keep this pressed firmly against the wound.
Charles, it appears she'll be here some time. Her parents should be told.
But I would rather not leave her. Not tonight.
Let me go. And if you wish, I'll take Henrietta and Mary with me.
And not Anne?
If Anne will stay, there is no one so proper, so capable.
Louisa needs no other.
But Anne...
Anne is to stay, who is nothing to Louisa, while I am sent packing?
Now, my dear, I'm sure the captain...
- Am I not as capable as Anne? - Of course you are.
Am I not as proper?
And to be sent home without Charles, too, without my husband, in my condition, no.
No, it is too unkind.
I will go with Henrietta.
Go on.
Miss Elliot,
I've been thinking whether you had not better remain with Henrietta while I go in and break it to the Musgrove's alone.
Do you think this is a good plan?
I do.
I must see Mr Musgrove without delay.
Tell him Captain Frederick Wentworth is here. I must speak with him directly.
It is done.
I shall return now to Lyme and see if I can be of any... any assistance.
I believe the Musgroves will soon follow.
Thank you.
Captain,
I'm most anxious.
If you would have...
If you'd be so kind as to have word sent to me in Bath as to how Louisa does.
In Bath?
I'm not needed in Lyme or any longer at Uppercross.
I must rejoin my father.
Our house is in Camden Place.
- You dislike Bath most heartily, as I recall. - I do.
But I have an old school friend who lives there and...
I have the consolation also of Lady Russell's company.
Very well, then.
Goodbye, Miss Elliot.
Goodbye, Captain Wentworth.
Certainly now, with Anne here,
I'll not suppose myself at all wanted.
Nonsense, Penelope, she is nothing to me, indeed, compared to you.
My dear madam, you must not run away from us now. It must not be.
Please, Penelope.
Ah, Anne, there you are.
How are you, Anne?
Are we greatly missed at Kellynch?
But let me assure you, Bath has more than answered our expectations in every respect.
Indeed, our house is undoubtedly the finest in Camden Place.
You can be sure that the acquaintance of the Elliots is most exceedingly sought after.
And best of all, Miss Anne, your cousin Mr Elliot is here in Bath and is quite reconciled with Sir Walter.
- Mr Elliot?
- Indeed, he has called repeatedly, has dined with us once.
Evidently delighted at the distinction of being asked.
And clearly places his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.
He has offered his most handsome apologies for any former appearance of neglect in his duties towards us.
And Mrs Elliot?
Dead. Quite dead.
Certainly his wife was a nobody, while a beauty and rich, but we must make allowances, he was young and foolish.
Not any more. Such elegant manners.
So gentlemanly and fashionable.
Indeed, I have no objection to being seen with him anywhere.
- Ah, that will be Lady Russell, no doubt. - No.
That is Mr Elliot's knock. I am sure of it.
I believe you are right.
The poor man simply cannot keep away from you, Miss Elliot.
Upon my word, Penelope.
I am scarcely aware of his intentions being beyond those of other men.
How is Mary looking?
Last time I saw her she was... Well, she had a red nose.
- Oh, she is quite well, thank you, Father. - Good.
My apologies for calling so unexpectedly but I could not rest without knowing that Miss Elliot had not taken cold yesterday.
Oh, how exceedingly kind of you, Mr Elliot.
Ah, my dear sir, give me leave to present my daughter Anne.
But this is extraordinary.
Our paths have crossed before, Sir Walter, at Lyme not a week past.
- Not that I could expect Miss Elliot to remember. - Indeed I do remember, Mr Elliot, very clearly.
How extraordinary that we should be guests at the same inn at the same time.
Yes, it is.
One might almost say... providential.
I cannot tell you how relieved I am to see her recovering so.
Yes and she will make an excellent wife, Frederick. I congratulate you.
I beg your pardon?
Come, sir, you're mistaken if you think you've kept your intentions towards Louisa Musgrove a secret.
You mean to say you consider an understanding exists between myself and Miss Musgrove?
- Of course. Do you deny it? - I do.
Do you mean to tell me you don't care for her at all?
No, not in that way, no. Rest assured.
Well, then I fear you'll gravely disappoint both her and her family.
They talk of little else.
Dear God, Harry, have I been so unguarded, so thoughtless?
It would appear that you have.
Well, if what you say is true then I must, in all honour, regard myself as bound to her.
Indeed, Frederick. I am afraid you seem to have entangled yourself.
This is dreadful. What can I do?
Perhaps you might take your leave of Lyme on some pretext, and await Louisa's recovery elsewhere.
It is perhaps possible a prolonged absence may weaken the bonds between you.
I have been meaning to visit my brother in Shropshire.
Capital.
- Captain Wentworth and Louisa Musgrove? - It's quite true. I assure you.
Any day now I expect to hear news of the engagement.
And you, child, are you reconciled to it?
Oh, yes, indeed.
- I wish them every happiness. - Mmm. Of course.
Oh, look, there's our Mr Elliot with the Wallaces.
I must admit he does have a very pleasant manner.
Indeed he does. And yet...
And yet?
I cannot help feeling that there must be something more than immediately appears in this sudden interest in our family, after so many years.
You refer to Elizabeth, I take it.
She is very handsome.
Well, he has nothing to gain from a reconciliation.
His late wife, however unsuitable a match, was exceedingly wealthy, and in any case nothing can prevent him from inheriting Kellynch and the baronetcy along with it.
Nothing except my father marrying again and providing himself at last with a male heir.
Ah. No, indeed.
And Mrs Clay is young and altogether well-looking.
I wonder at Elizabeth, to place such a woman under your father's nose so.
We must be vigilant.
- Ah, Lady Russell. - Ah, Lady Cavendish.
My dearest cousin, once again providence seems eager to throw us together.
Good morning, Mr Elliot.
I confess, I called nearly an hour ago at Camden Place and was most distressed to find you absent.
My father was quite taken up with some sensational news in this morning's paper.
You refer, of course, to your cousins, the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and her daughter the Honourable Miss Carteret, who arrive in Bath today.
You are very well informed, Mr Elliot.
Your father may have mentioned something on the subject.
I do not doubt that he did.
You do not seem anxious to make their acquaintance again.
I agree.
The Dalrymples are nothing in themselves, but family connections are always worth preserving.
And they are regarded everywhere as good company.
My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people who have a great deal of conversation.
You are mistaken. That is not good company.
That is the best.
No, good company requires only birth, manners and education and, with regard to education, I'm afraid it is not very particular.
Oh, my cousin Anne shakes her head. She is not satisfied.
In one point, however, I'm sure we must feel alike.
We welcome any addition to your father's society which diverts his thoughts from those who, well, are beneath him.
You refer to Mrs Clay?
It is possible that I do.
My concern is that my father may be rendered unhappy by the connection.
But perhaps I'm too fastidious.
My dear Anne, you have a better right to be fastidious than any woman I've ever met.
Oh, good heavens.
Mr Elliot not with you?
There is a letter come for you from Uppercross.
If you are quick you may just have time to read it before he calls again.
My dear Anne, I rejoice to tell you that Louisa improves daily and will soon be quite her old self.
I am also told we shall soon hear wedding bells at Uppercross, although I'm sworn to secrecy on the subject and may say no more.
But Mama says the local dressmakers will not answer for such an occasion.
So, expect to see us at Bath next week for a fitting.
Until then, I remain your affectionate brother-in-law, Charles Musgrove.
Anne.
Anne. Anne.
Come, come, Anne, we must not be late.
You cannot have forgotten we have an invitation from Lady Dalrymple.
I regret I am already engaged to spend the evening with an old school friend.
Not that sickly old widow in Westgate Buildings?
- Mrs Smith, yes. - Smith?
- Westgate Buildings? - Excuse me.
And who, pray, is Mrs Smith?
One of the 5,000 Smiths that are everywhere to be met with?
Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most extraordinary taste.
To place such a person ahead of your own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland.
Mrs Smith.
Perhaps she's not the only poor widow in Bath with little to live on and no surname of dignity.
Good evening.
- Anne. - Harriet.
- How are you? - I'm well, thank you. Much better.
This is my nurse Mrs Rooke.
- How do you do, Miss Elliot? - Mrs Rooke.
I am truly sorry I've been unable to visit before this.
My time has not been my own.
Oh, but we are deeply honoured to have a cousin of Lady Dalrymple pay us a visit here this evening instead of calling upon her relations with the rest of her family.
You will soon learn that absolutely nothing happens in Bath without Nurse Rooke hearing of it.
Come, dearest Anne, tell me everything that has happened to you in the past 12 years.
Harry.
Harry.
Harry. Harry.
Frederick.
I called at the inn but Louisa's gone back home to Uppercross, I find.
A week ago, at least. Benwick took her. She's quite recovered.
How is your brother?
He thinks I'm as big a fool as I do.
You have no idea, Harry, how I... how I curse the folly of my own pride.
Had I only the good sense to seize my happiness when I had the chance again and none of this would have happened.
I'm not sure I follow.
I imagine myself indifferent to her but I was only angry and resentful.
Too late.
Too late I began to understand myself and her.
Never, never have I met her equal in good sense or sweetness of character.
She's perfection itself.
I've never loved any but her.
- We are talking now of Anne Elliot? - Of course, who else?
Then I take it you have not received Benwick's letter.
I shall have to go to Uppercross now. It cannot, in all decency, be avoided.
I mention this letter only because it contains the news that he has proposed to Louisa Musgrove.
She has accepted him. They are to be married directly.
Married?
- Louisa and Benwick? - Directly.
Then... Then I'm free.
As it happens, I'm going to Bath tomorrow.
Perhaps now you'd care to join me.
And whom should I chance to meet at the Pump Rooms again yesterday but Mr Elliot.
Without being indiscreet,
I can reveal that you were very much talked of.
He thinks you a most extraordinary young woman.
In your temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.
Now, I am no matchmaker, as you well know, but a most suitable connection.
And I do think there would be every possibility of your and Mr Elliot being very happy together.
And, I must confess, to look forward and think of you occupying your dear mother's place as the future mistress of Kellynch.
The future Lady Elliot.
Oh, my dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life.
Lady Russell.
Will you join us?
I cannot deny the idea of being restored to Kellynch, of calling it home again, my home forever, has a charm I cannot immediately resist.
And Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and, in many respects, I think very highly of him.
Admiral and Mrs Croft come to call on Miss Anne Elliot.
Admiral, Mrs Croft, I'm delighted to see you.
What brings you here to Bath?
I'm afraid, Miss Elliot, it is my digestion.
And when your sister Mary learned we were to come to Bath, she charged us with this letter for you.
Thank you. You must stay for tea.
And tell me the news from Kellynch.
Well, all the talk, of course, has been of the marriage.
- The marriage? - Why, your cousin of course.
Miss Louisa Musgrove.
Do you mean to tell me you did not know?
No, indeed.
I only had a note from Charles that we were to soon expect a wedding.
Oh, well, then I'm sure the letter we have brought from your sister will contain a full account.
I'm very happy for Louisa.
- I am certain she has chosen wisely. Indeed, indeed.
Oh, he's a fine fellow, right enough.
And whatever Frederick may say, she has no fears of being a naval captain's wife.
No, indeed.
I must confess the news did come as something of a surprise to us.
Even Sophy was taken aback.
Really? Did he give you no indication of his intentions?
No. No, never a word on the subject.
But Frederick is not a man to pine or complain.
No, he very honourably hoped she will be very happy with Benwick and there's an end to it.
In fact, from his manner of speaking on the subject, one would never guess Frederick could have ever thought of Louisa Musgrove for himself.
Benwick?
I beg your pardon?
Am I, then, to understand that Louisa is to marry Captain Benwick and not Captain Wentworth?
Yes. Yes, that's it exactly.
Poor Frederick. Now he will have to begin all over with somebody else.
Miss Anne, is something wrong?
No. No, you astonished me indeed.
You mean, you did not know?
The thing is certainly true. We have it from Frederick himself.
- Captain Wentworth is in Bath? - He arrived last night.
Oh.
Captain Wentworth.
Miss Elliot.
Your sister mentioned your being in Bath.
Yes, I'm lodging with the Admiral in Queen's Square.
You've perhaps also heard that Louisa Musgrove is to marry James Benwick.
- I have. I was most astonished. - As was I.
And yet, I'm sure in time they will grow more alike.
Captain Benwick will gain high spirits and cheerfulness and she will...
Relish for morbid poetry.
Just so.
With all my soul, I wish them happy, and yet...
Miss Louisa is a very good, amiable, sweet-tempered girl.
Harville's sister was a very superior woman, and Benwick's attachment to her was, indeed, profound.
A man cannot recover from such a passion with such a woman.
He ought not.
He does not.
My dear Anne, I cannot say how grieved I am to have kept you waiting, but the carriage is outside.
Mr Elliot, permit me to name Captain Wentworth.
My cousin Mr Elliot.
May I?
Captain, there is a concert at the Pump Rooms tonight.
I remember how fond you are of music.
I must say, though, the worst of Bath is the number of plain women.
I frequently observe that one pretty face would be followed by five and thirty frights.
And as for the men...
Oh.
Ah, Lady Russell.
We are at home tomorrow night to a somewhat select gathering...
- We do so hope you are at liberty. - Of course, Sir Walter, with pleasure.
But where is Lady Dalrymple?
Good heavens, is that Frederick Wentworth?
Isn't he the nobody?
What on earth is he doing in Bath?
Captain Wentworth, is the programme to your liking?
I found myself at liberty this evening.
Bath has much to offer those who are interested in music.
So I'm led to believe.
And shall you be staying long in Bath?
I don't know.
That is to say, I am not certain.
It all depends.
I see.
- Miss Elliot... - Captain.
(FOOTMAN ANNOUNClNG ARRlVALS) (GASPS) Lady Dalrymple.
Anne, Anne, Lady Dalrymple is here.
There'll soon be another marriage in that family, if I'm any judge.
Certainly, if the rumours are to be believed.
Captain.
Captain.
- Are you going? - Yes.
Is the first half, at least, not worth staying for?
No.
There's nothing here worth me staying for. Good night.
My dear Anne, is all well?
We are all so dreadfully concerned.
Yes.
I felt suddenly a little faint.
But I'm quite recovered.
Should we not return to the concert?
Dearest Anne,
I have been awaiting an opportunity to speak to you privately and now it seems to have come.
- I'm sorry, sir, I'm not very good company.
- My dear cousin, you are far too modest for the world in general to be aware
- of even half your accomplishments. - Really, sir,
- I do not think you know me that well. - On the contrary.
The name of Anne Elliot has long had a beguiling charm for me.
If I dared, I would now breathe my sincerest wish that name might never change.
- Sir...
- I do not venture to expect an immediate answer to my proposal.
But I cannot, in honour, further conceal my intentions and perhaps tomorrow night at Camden Place you will feel able to make me the happiest and most fortunate of men.
Miss Elliot, I am charged with an urgent commission from the Admiral in regard to your family.
And since I am to leave Bath today without delay,
I should be obliged if I could wait upon you at 11.:00 this morning.
Hello, Anne, how are you?
Charles, Mary.
I am here to take the waters.
I have been most dreadfully unwell, it is my last hope.
Father, Elizabeth.
Good heavens, it's Mary.
Sir Walter, Elizabeth, we have come to choose a wedding dress with mother and Henrietta.
- Who? - A mere country curate.
- Father, pray, do not trouble yourself. - And dear Louisa, is she not with you?
She stayed at Uppercross with Captain Benwick.
- Who? - The naval captain, Father.
Pray, do not trouble yourself.
I suppose we shall have to invite the Musgroves tonight as well.
A party?
I shall be loathe to introduce them to Lady Dalrymple.
Will Mr Elliot be there? I must at all costs be introduced to Mr Elliot.
Well, I have not the smallest intention of inviting him, but...
Wentworth.
- Charles. - Hello, old fellow, how are you?
I didn't expect to see you here.
Where are you staying? We must go shooting one day, if you have time.
- Mrs Musgrove. - Captain.
Father, this is Captain Wentworth.
He is related to our tenants, the Crofts.
Captain, this is my father, Sir Walter Elliot, baronet.
Yes and my eldest sister Elizabeth.
- Thank you, we are acquainted. - Captain, please.
I am charged.
That is to say the Admiral, Admiral Croft, has been confidently informed... that Mr Elliot...
That everything is settled now in your family for a union between yourself and Mr Elliot.
It was added that you were to live at Kellynch, and my commission from the Admiral is to say that, if the family's wish is such, his lease at Kellynch shall be cancelled and he and my sister will provide themselves with another home.
That is all.
What answer shall I give?
Sir...
You will please thank the Admiral on my behalf, but I must tell you that he is utterly misinformed.
Misinformed?
- Utterly? - Yes, Captain.
Quite mistaken.
- No truth in any part of it? - None.
And I should be grateful to know the source of such fanciful rumours.
As to that... (KNOCKlNG AT DOOR)
Lady Russell is here.
Do you remember Lady Russell, Captain?
How could I forget?
Anne, I received your note.
Miss Elliot, if you'll excuse me I shall convey your news to the Admiral.
- Good day. - Captain.
Is it true? Mr Elliot has proposed?
If you'll excuse me, Lady Russell, I must speak with Captain Wentworth.
Captain Wentworth.
Mrs Musgrove.
Anne.
What a delight.
Excuse me.
Anne, I must speak with you.
Must it be now?
Anne, I must ask. Is it true Mr Elliot has asked you to marry him?
- Yes, but...
- Anne, I hope I give no offence, but I can never forgive myself if I did not acquaint you with Mr Elliot's real character.
- I only hope I'm not too late. - Good heavens, Harriet, what is it?
Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience.
A designing, cold-blooded being who thinks only of itself.
His recent reconciliation with your father was no accident.
He had heard a rumour in London that Sir Walter Elliot might be led to marry his daughter's companion.
- Mrs Clay? - The very same.
And should she provide him with an heir, of course, the child would inherit everything, instead of Mr Elliot.
- But he is already rich. - Of course.
He married his poor wife for money and nothing else.
But what he now desires above all is to be a baronet.
He cannot bear the thought of not being Sir William.
Well, why, then, would he wish to marry me?
Oh, his admiration for you is sincere, as far as it goes.
Although it has not prevented him from courting Mrs Clay at the same time.
- No. - Indeed.
He has promised to establish her as his mistress in London, as soon as he is married to you.
There is nothing he would not do to prevent your father marrying again.
I am profoundly grateful to you, Harriet.
But now if you'll forgive me, I must go.
- Captain Harville. - Miss Elliot.
If you have come to call upon the Admiral and Mrs Croft, I must disappoint you.
They went to take the waters with Captain Wentworth.
But since you are here, you may save me some time.
Captain Wentworth bade me bring this note to you in Camden Place.
Perhaps you would take it now.
- Thank you. - Are you quite well, Miss Elliot?
Thank you.
Then if you'll excuse me, I'm already late for an appointment.
Miss Elliot, I can bear this no longer.
You pierced my soul. I'm half agony, half hope.
Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant.
I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years ago.
I have loved none but you.
You alone, who brought me to Bath, for you alone, I think and plan.
Have you not seen this?
I can hardly write.
I must go, uncertain of my fate.
A word, a look, would be enough.
Only tell me that I am...
Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone forever.
Why, Miss Elliot, you just missed Frederick.
He has just gone to call upon you at Camden Place.
Anne.
- Charles. - Anne, good heavens, is anything the matter?
Anne.
Thank you, Charles, I'm quite... quite well.
You look quite done for. We shall have to get you home directly.
The thing of it is, I ought to be in the marketplace now.
A fellow there promised me the sight of a capital gun he's just sending off.
Said he'd keep it unpacked till the last possible minute.
If I do not cut along now I shall miss out.
You know from his description, Wentworth, it sounds a good deal like that 16-bore Mortimer of mine you shot with that day round Winthrop.
Do you remember?
Captain...
Captain,
I am... I am in receipt of your proposal and am minded to accept it.
Thank you.
Are you quite certain?
I am.
I am determined.
I will.
And nothing, you may be sure, will ever persuade me otherwise.
Why have we stopped?
You can't see?
Give me your hand.
I thought you might like to see your wedding present.
My nose hair is out of control lately.
'Cause the air's dirty.
Any luck with last night's Lotto 4?
Washed out.
Told ya.
You'll never hit with those numbers.
But I really loved her.
Winning the lotto using the name... of a chick who dumped you is... -
Her name's Go-{i>ten{/i> Na-mi.
Four numbers: 5, 10, 7 and 3.
Hold on.
5 and 10, right?
5, 1, 0, 7, and 3?
That's five numbers not four?
Huh? Go-ten? 5, 1 or 0.
I see. Which did you use 1 or 0?
1.
Idiot! No wonder you never win.
Mind if we turn on the lights?
No problem!
Sorry but we gotta work too, you know.
Actually that works for us too!
That ain't for you to say. Sorry boss.
Actually that works for us too! Thanks!
That's exactly what I said.
Evening.
Oh, evening.
Evening.
Sorry to take so long. Sorry.
This container reeks something awful.
Thought you'd better take a look.
Really?
Well, better open it up.
Hair.
Human hair.
Materials for hair extensions.
Used for what?
Extensions. You know, fake hair.
Extensions?
This whole zone is filled with hair.
Get real.
That's what the man said. Lately young chicks wear these... in their hair for fashion.
Nothing looks out of the ordinary.
Is that smell from the hair?
Human hair's gotta stink a bit, eh?
Locked in this crate for weeks, right?
You'd think it'd stink, eh?
No peeking! Turn away.
"Mr. Lonely Heart, see you tonight too." Got-cha. Person.
Person.
Takashima, a person.
A person?
Dead body?
Call the police.
Right.
Yamazaki. I'm outta here.
See you tomorrow.
Almost forgot.
The cops found something... amazing at the harbor earlier.
Did they?
It arrives tomorrow.
Understood.
Later.
Good night, sir.
Die.
Cheap imitation.
To the dump for you.
We understand each other, right?
Life's tough.
If it isn't genius hair stylist... in training Yuko Mizushima... once again fast asleep at her table... from another all-nighter.
Better get up or...
Morning. Morning.
If isn't Yuki Morita wannabe pro dancer, my roommate for over a month.
Darn. At this rate... I'll be late for my job of two years at... salon Gilles de Rais.
"I gotta get moving to my part-time job... that pays for my dance studio fees."
I say, "See you later" and exit.
"Later".
I might be home late.
You're always late.
What?
Forgot something.
Space cadet.
I'm off.
See you.
Hi-ho hi-ho, it's off to work I go. Here I go.
I always ride on this road but... that's no reason not to drive safely.
Yuko Mizushima. Age 20.
This hair stylist in training heads off... aiming to be a great stylist one day.
Through the tunnel, we find...
the same town.
This town shows various expressions.
Sky, mountains, greenery.
Hilly, narrow and wide streets.
As if time stands still under this blue sky.
I love this town. Morning!
See you!
If necessary, observe all hand signals. Of course, safe driving comes first.
Cutting through the temple and fish shop...
The sea is near.
Surf and sun.
The sea in the morning is lovely. But I can't get too absorbed in it.
Down the main street and turning right.
Almost there.
Being ten minutes late, I get off in a fluster.
Rupin move. Thanks. Any hair in here?
Sorry!
I know, I'm late.
If it isn't Sachi, my coworker, another stylist in training... and disciple of beauty.
"Are you still at it?" I say in humorous tone.
Sachi answers, "Picking up from yesterday?"
Sachi proposes, "Everyone at our salon will talk like this."
What Sachi who been at the salon two years meant was... we've have been using overexplicit dialogue and everyone laughs at it.
We started and now it's a habit. We can't stop ourselves.
Morning.
Good morning!
Bonjour, Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir. - Bonjour.
On a TV drama last week... this habit to explain circumstances... came from similar dialogue like...
"Well if it isn't Mr. Toda who I met a month ago walking over."
You said it.
Morning.
Good morning!
Good morning! Morning.
Morning.
The name's Gilles de Rais. It's French, ya know. Morning.
Good morning!
Morning.
Good morning.
Morning. Good morning.
Don't stop working.
Yuriko, did you finish that cut in the given time yesterday?
Yes! No worries.
Listen up.
Mind the client's time as well as your own.
If you can finish earlier, the client can have time to get a coffee. can have time to get a coffee.
Your ambitions are important too.
But the client is giving you her time, not the other way around.
Yes.
Let's get to it.
Hurry up.
This isn't the way to school, mommy.
It's fine. Move it.
What the hell?
Hair?
From the cargo container? Hair extensions?
The kidneys are?
Obviously been plucked clean.
And her eye too?
Been surgically removed too.
Must be a white slavery victim from some foreign country.
Meaning?
The world's full of black market human organ trading routes.
Organ trading?
Kidnapped.
Kidnapped?
Kidnapped and had her organs harvested.
And the surgery was done by a pro.
One talented doctor for sure.
Was she hidden in that container?
Or did she hide escaping the surgery? Or did she hide escaping the surgery?
Are those extensions hers too?
Don't ask me.
Umm...
You finished?
Not yet.
Done.
Okay.
It's growing already.
You're quick.
Growing from your tongue too.
You crying?
You crying?
'Cause the world's cruel?
I'm starving. What'd you buy for dinner?
Who's that?
Mami.
She was asleep at our door.
"Dear Yuko, 1) If you try to return her,
I'm not at my old house."
"2) Mind her for a while." "3) I'll call you.
From Kiyomi."
Hello.
Hello sis.
Kiyomi's answering service.
Leave a message.
Don't take me wrong but no slanderous messages. Be-e-e-p.
Answer! Don't push your kid off on me!
You never change. How many times do I have to clean up your messes?
Now it's the kid, huh?
Get real. Look after your own brat! They hung up.
Sorry to trouble you. Please let me stay one night.
Your mom will pick you up tomorrow.
You can use the bed over there. Now, go to sleep.
Okay, understood.
Thank you so much.
I'll make her pay.
Don't say that about your sister.
Half-sister!
As a child, she was my slave.
You're my slave now.
Growing. It's growing.
It's growing!
It's growing!
Morning Mami.
Good morning.
Mami... can you show me your body?
There's nothing to see.
How about your back then?
Wait! Mami.
Yuki, grab her. What's wrong?
Look.
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Who could... -
My sister.
What? Stolen?
Yeah.
What happened last night?
I was last to leave. No evidence of other stolen bodies.
No evidence of other stolen bodies. But...
But the hair's been... -
How so?
What the fuck!
Get serious!
Sorry.
What's with that look?
Stop it.
You made him cry.
Doesn't Yamazaki give you the creeps?
Don't judge people based on them creeping you out.
Sorry.
I'll be back after work. Be good and wait patiently.
Understood. I'm a pro at waiting patiently.
If you need anything, call me here.
Yes.
See you.
Lock the door, okay?
If it isn't stylist wannabe Yuko walking there?
I'll never give up!
Morning. Good morning!
At least you answer well.
So when you go independent... never forget that you're pros.
To win your clients' trust must participate in workshops.
Cuts change into new styles so these techniques and... win your clients' trust.
See you tomorrow.
Tomorrow then.
That trust has to be treated preciously.
Open up. Mami.
Open the door now.
Mami.
Mami. I know you're in there!
Open up!
Mami!
What took so long? What gives!
I'm sorry.
What's she doing with nice coat.
Stop staring.
Sit straight.
Yes.
The fan.
It fell over.
Fix it!
Yes.
What the hell are you doin'?
Mami, who's this?
So you're Mami's... -
And this is Yuko's house. Who the hell are you?
It's {i>our{/i> place.
What? You lesbians?
You dumb?
She never did have any luck with men.
Get out.
I said, "Out." Didn't you hear?
Sister.
How could you let her in?
She let herself in.
Guess I'm in the way. I'll go.
We're leaving Mami.
Wait. What'd you do to her?
These bruises?
She's covered with them.
- Tattletale!
- This doesn't concern her!
Doesn't concern her?
Who's kid do you think she is? She's my mine.
You own her?
I named her.
Don't say her name so damn frivolously. Ask for my permission.
This broken cup is yours, so I'm sorry.
But I made Mami so don't go... lecturing me about what I own.
Got it?
Then answer me. Just like the old days. Let's hear it.
Yes?
Yes, yes, yes!
Not you, stupid.
Do you love her? What'd you say?
Don't preach to me about love.
Listen to yourself. I'm not the one who had the abortion.
A broken cup... can be put back together but... the baby you dissected is long gone.
But that was... - A mistake.
Everybody makes them.
Doesn't change the fact you snuffed out a human life. What's a selfish girl like you gonna tell a person...
like me who kept her child and raised it?
Well? What? Say it!
Mami. Come home with mommy.
Wait!
I won't hand her over to you.
Not to her mother? She's not yours to give back.
Now that I know you beat her, I won't hand her over.
What's with you?
Trying to atone for the child you killed?
Stop it!
Shut your hole!
I'm calling the cops.
Go ahead. I'll tell 'em what for.
Don't you watch the news?
Abusing children even your own is a crime. Forget it.
Take her.
Fine with me.
Hey, that's mine.
Whatever.
Bye-bye Mami.
Hello?
Get over here!
Idiot! {i>Waiting. I'm always waiting.{/i>
Oh? Wait a little longer.
{i>Wait. Just a little bit longer.{/i>
Mami.
You can live here for a while. I'm sorry.
Don't hit me.
I can't be a good girl. That's why I made mommy angry.
But I can be good. I'll be good.
You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't do anything wrong.
Let it grow.
Keep growing and growing forever.
Wonderful.
You're wonderful.
Lovely. Simply... lovely.
Lovely but I gotta trim you.
So sorry.
All dirty women have to do something... about their filthy hair!
Don't you think so?
Hi.
Always nice seeing you.
Something amazing has come in.
Wanna try some out?
It's beautiful.
Told you. They're the real deal.
They'll look perfect on you.
You think?
Wow! Looks great!
Very fine.
Are those extensions? Really beautiful.
Yeah. Nice, huh? Wanna try?
I'll settle for a cut today. Next time then.
Oh, you're angry. It's growing.
You're angry.
Amazing.
My hair just doesn't grow.
Don't sleep and it'll grow.
A client told me so. Really? Guess I'll stay up late too.
What the hell!
Oh no. I'm bleeding.
I'll be gentle with you. Come here.
What!?
It hurts. It hurts?
Why? Why!
You're a bad girl! Right?
You're so bad.
You bad girl.
Bad, bad, bad girl.
Bad girl!
It's been a while.
Mommy, this shop is red.
{i>Let it grow.
Let it grow.{/i> {i>Let it grow today.{/i> {i>This afternoon at this hair salon...{/i> {i>in Abesada a female customer...{/i> {i>was killed by her hair dresser...{/i> {i>who then took her own life.{/i>

Your doing?
Amazing. Simply amazing. You're great when you're angry.
Horrible eh?
Didn't step on any blood, did you?
Rockabye, rockabye. Bye.
Rockabye, rockabye. Bye.
Hey you.
Why are you so lovely?
But that's not couth to ask, eh?
Like the clothes I picked?
But that's not couth either, eh?
Give the girl upstairs extensions.
Okay.
Now... where's some lovely hair?
Anyone with lovely hair?
How filthy.
I wanna fill this town with lovely hair!
Anyone with lovely hair?
Huh?
Huh? Huh?
That girl.
What lovely hair you have. You lost?
Wonder what I'm gonna do?
Bruises, eh?
Were you abused by this world? My name's Yamazaki.
Gunji Yamazaki.
What's your name little lady?
Excuse me. My name is Yamazaki.
How can I help you?
Is Yuko Mizushima here?
Yuko... customer.
Yuko?
Coming.
My name is Yamazaki.
This girl... -
Mami.
Uh... she, well, she seemed lost.
I'm sorry. I broke your things.
Are you her mother?
No, I...
I thought... her hair is so... and your hair is so...
How great, Mami. Huh?
Well... I'm in the way so see you.
Please wait.
Yes?
Thank you very much.
No, no, don't mention it. Really. Right?
What lovely hair you have.
If all the bitches in the world...
I mean..."women"... had hair like yours.
Back to work.
Yuko... you got a kid?
Sorry for the disturbance.
I told you to stay home, right?
Sorry. What's wrong?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Don't go causing trouble here.
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'll give you until 3 pm. Do something about her.
Yes. Thanks. Let's go.
Don't hit me.
I won't.
Don't hit me.
740 yen.
Here. Ma'am?
A mother should never hit her child.
Mother?
Please mother. Straighten up.
Huh?
Be careful. Thanks. We're going.
Come on.
Oh no! How horrible.
Don't mess with my mannequins, okay?
Yes.
What's with this hair style?
Yes.
Don't "yes" me.
Yes.
Don't say "yes"!
Yes.
I've gotta get back to work. 501 a. Don't move.
Got it? Yes.
Don't touch anything. Don't even clean up!
You like comics?
I don't understand. Understood.
If you get bored, read this.
I'm off. And lock the door.
Understood.
If you get hungry, gratin's in the fridge.
{i>Thank you very much.{/i> {i>No, no, don't mention it.
Really.{/i>
{i>What lovely hair you have.{/i>
{i>If all the bitches in the world...{/i> {i>I mean "women"...{/i> {i>had hair like yours.{/i>
I'll be back.
Hi everyone, good afternoon. Oh, it's night; good evening.
The guy from... -
Yes but actually I... sell... these. Oh!
Hair extensions, right? Right.
Take a look. Here.
- Here. Here. - Hey, look guys.
How sweet. What country are they from?
China? - No, no. - They're not Asian?
It's a trade secret.
But I've been showing them... to salons on a free sample basis.
If you'd like, try them out.
You sure?
Please.
Yama...
Yamazaki.
Mr. Yamazaki, these will be a hit.
You think? Happy to hear it.
- Is this the only sample? - Come on. It's free.
I'm ready to buy them.
Thank you.
If you don't mind, I can bring more tomorrow.
Take a look. Come closer.
She's got such lovely hair.
Oh... she's still an apprentice. A hard worker though.
Really? She's got lovely hair.
Bye.
Well everyone, that's it for tonight.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How creepy.
He was praising your hair. You don't know him, right?
I'm taking off.
See you tomorrow.
These are great.
You said it.
Sachi?
What's your model like for the next workshop?
I scored someone on the street.
With hair that needs a cutting.
I see.
Kondo, how are those extensions?
Great.
I almost wanna wear them home.
Why don't you?
They look so natural.
You can go too, Sachi.
Oh, thank you.
Yuko, got a sec?
What happened today?
I'm really sorry.
If you wanna be a qualified stylist, get your personal life in order.
I'm sorry.
See you tomorrow. Tomorrow then.
Yuko... need a model for the workshop?
Thanks. But no thanks.
OK.
Not that kid, right?
Is something in my hair?
I'm home.
You still up?
How was your day?
I said you didn't have to clean. Relax.
Sit like this.
Yes.
A simple "yeah" is fine.
Did you eat?
Yes.
I'll make you a bath.
Understood.
Just say "gotcha". Please.
Gotcha.
That's more like it.
Gotcha.
And please call me sis.
Gotcha, sis.
I bought these for you.
Hope you like them. Ta-da. Cute, huh?
Try them on. There's more.
This one's cute too.
I'm home.
Welcome back. Let's go.
Welcome back.
I'm home. I did some shopping.
What'd you buy?
Guess? Ta-da. Pajamas for Mami.
What?
What's happening? You angry?
Right? Getting mad?
As always thank you.
I liked the cut. I'll be back.
Thank you. Please come again.
She won't answer. Kondo seemed fine last night, right?
Totally fine.
Left right after that.
Not the kind of girl to cut work without calling.
Mami.
Mami.
Mami.
Mami. I know you're in there.
Mami.
Mami. You're home, right?
I'm sorry I left you here for a while.
Could you open the door?
You haven't been to school. Your teachers are worried.
Won't you show mommy your face?
Sis told me not to open the door.
Yuko did?
Yes, she did.
Mommy regrets what she did.
I'm truly sorry.
I came to apologize.
Open the door and show me your face? Open the door and show me your face?
That's a good girl.
Open the damn door, idiot!
I'm sorry.
Don't "sorry" me.
Her bank book. Come on.
Help me!
But those are sister's.
Whose kid do you think you are? Whose?
Say it!
Get a job, hair girl!
Get a move on!
My fingernail's split. Take a look.
What's wrong, honey?
This uppity punk in the bar. I swung at him and jammed my hand.
That bar attracts bad types.
Lately, kids... no goddamn manners.
That includes you! How do we answer?
Yes.
Before you lived with Yuko, you knew how to answer.
She's picked up Yuko's bad habits. Right?
Smack her?
Teach her the restraint of being a lady.
Understood. Yes sir.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
I can't hear you and your baby voice.
Speak louder.
Kids who don't listen get punished.
It hurts! My broken nail hurts.
Poor baby.
I'll suck it for you.
It stings.
That tickles.
Hey look, look. Today's prize.
Look. A new coat.
Where'd you get that?
A kind person gave it to me.
And this too.
Nothing for me? Nope. Owch.
Still?
This hurts too.
What the!
Hair is... growing on your arm.
Gross. What the... -
No peeking, idiot!
Hello? Oh, Yuko.
About 2 I guess.
Mami was studying. She should be home.
Look out!
Is Mami okay?
- Mami Mizushima? - Yes.
It was a minor injury. She's fine.
Thank you.
Miss Yuko Mizushima?
Yes.
Detective Sugawara. This is...
Tamura.
My sister.
A monster.
A monster?
A monster?
A hair monster killed my mommy.
Mami.
It's the truth.
There's a connection.
To the hair?
My gut tells me it's linked to the missing female corpse.
The cargo container girl?
One and the same. Somehow...
Somehow? Somehow doesn't solve cases.
Sorry.
We can't inform HQ on a hunch. No way. No way.
It's all natural hair.
Everyone.
Today was hard on us all.
Kondo's death was a shock but that doesn't concern our customers.
Brace yourselves emotionally and focus on our work.
Are... we going ahead with the workshop?
As planned.
You too, Yuko.
Okay?
Fine.
Mami.
Yeah?
I wanna give you this.
Cut it all you like. But be careful with scissors.
Really?
Practice using scissors first.
Hold them like this. Great.
Nice.
Yuko, you up?
Thanks for being my model.
OK
You think anyone will shoot video for me?
I'll ask somebody.
Great. Good night.
Night.
Can I ask you something?
Sure. What?
Why'd you find a job cutting hair?
That's... well...
Ever since I was little, I loved going to the beauty parlor with mom.
The stylists there were really talented.
I loved to watch my mother sitting in front of the mirror.
I was enchanted by their hand movements.
My heart pounded as I watched my mother's beauty change.
Little by little, my mother transformed into a woman I'd never seen before.
One day, the stylist asked me if I wanted a hair cut.
I was still in elementary school. I never thought I'd get to sit in the adult chairs. So I sat down and looked in the mirror... at my ugly self.
I should have never sat down. I knew it was wrong to sit down.
Totally... but that stylist... before I knew it, myself in the mirror changed.
I could barely stand it
looking through the mirror.
I thought how amazing to be able to do such magic.
I looked at his face and it was like... the face of a person doing something great.
Someone filled with confidence. I thought someday I'll learn that technique.
I'll be like him.
I wanna feel the way you do too.
You do?
Huh?
I see.
Wanna give it a try?
So they matched, eh? Thank you.
Bye. The DNA lab results?
The hair fiber from every case is from that girl.
But that's...
Added all up, it should be the hair... of 30 women.
How can that be?
Don't ask me.
It's Sugawara. The results are in. They all match.
We'll assume all the cases are related.
Keep you in the loop. We're outta here.
Why do I have to be your model again?
I wanna try out a new style.
Here we go Jun.
Have your way with me.
Let's go, Mami. Let's go.
Good morning. Morning.
You're late.
Sorry.
Is she your cut model?
Yes.
I'm Mami. Please treat me favorably.
She's a kid.
The one from before.
You're right.
Let's begin.
Over there Mami.
You have 45 minutes. Skill doesn't count. If you can't finish in time, you're out.
Ready.
Yuko, hurry up.
Now, start.
Good luck.
I'll make this a Kodak moment for you.
Keep your cool.
20 minutes.
Yuko, don't rush.
30 minutes.
I'm gonna give you extensions.
Excuse me.
Can I have a minute?
What is it?
Whose that?
I'm sorry everyone. We'll have to stop.
The detectives have some questions. Please give them your attention.
You cut models are free to go.
We appreciate your cooperation.
What happened? Probably related to Kondo.
Done!
Nice work.
You did it.
Way to go, Yuko. What do you think?
That's it for today.
Thanks for your help.
Next please.
What's up?
One of our customers died after leaving here.
Mrs. Suzuki?
I gave her extensions.
They kept grilling me about extensions.
Is that somehow related to Kondo?
Do you often use these?
We usually use these.
Are these special?
A strange man brought them in a bird cage.
Were those extensions the ones that guy brought? The guy in overalls.
That guy?
Brought them in a bird cage. Brought them in a bird cage.
Has he been here before?
- What was his name? - I can't recall.
That night Kondo wore home the extensions he brought.
Yamazaki.
His name?
Yamazaki.
Yamazaki.
{i>I'm gonna give you extensions.{/i>
Sorry but I gotta go.
Yuko wait.
Hair has a way of falling everywhere.
Look how much.
The phone?
A fax?
I'm starving. Wonder how long Yuko'll be.
You look like a pro stylist.
Gimme a break.
Is this extension the same as the one you're wearing?
Yep.
Then she'll look as cute as you. Then she'll look as cute as you.
I can't wait any more.
What do you wanna do?
- You wanna wait? - I'll wait.
Really?
Done!
Huh?
Show me. How is it?
You're getting better.
You've got a bright future.
Mami.
Don't look behind you.
What the hell?
Mami run.
Who's it gonna be today?
Maybe... those girls?
Yuki! Mami!
What?
Mami?
Yuki?
Mami, Mami.
Stop, stop. Stop it!
Let go of these girls.
What lovely hair you have.
What the fuck.
Is all this hair?
Looks like it.
Sugawara?
Look over there.
The cargo container woman?
Hair relaxes me.
I was always alone.
So now, I'm very happy.
So happy together.
Bound together by hair.
Oh dear.
You're all over the place. What now?
Why'd you do it?
What do we have here?
Fuck off. What happened?
You poor boys.
How lonely.
How pitiful and empty. Stop.
They always, always, always... drove me hard at that morgue, working me to the bone day after day.
What's so wrong?
With cutting someone's hair?
What's so wrong with it?
Stop.
What? - Stop what? What?
- Stop. I can't hear you.
What? I can't hear you!
Shape up? Act properly?
He's dead. Dropped dead.
Dead as a door nail.
We'll let this one live!
Detective, I haven't done anything wrong.
Sure, I brought her home but... she's not dead. Very much alive.
Her hair is amazing, eh?
So thick with a rich, glossy luster.
She's an amazing girl. Simply amazing.
But she's suffered up until now.
But since I met her, no more. I haven't searched for anyone else.
But these two are different.
These two are the best. So talented. So lovely.
Surrounded by hair, living among it.
Making a life of hair. Putting their interests to good use.
What do you want?
Hear me out, senorita.
This girl is so pitiful.
While she was living, her organs... and eye were ripped out and sold.
And so her hair raged.
Will you live with us forever? Please.
No. Stay away. Don't come near me.
Mami, run!
Stop it.
Huh?
Stop.
Stop.
Don't you mess with her hair.
I'm not.
You're out!
That'll learn you to mess with hair.
Your hair looks delicious.
Stay away from my sister!
You sweet deary, I'm make dinner out of you.
If you love your hair like this... you'll be like me.
Don't you get near her!
Owch!
Now, I'm angry.
Did you see that?
I always told you I was a gentleman, but I can't quietly stand by after that.
Senorita...
I'm gonna cut that hair for you.
Don't hurt my sister!
Back off or I'll start with you!
Come on, you freak!
You want my hair?
You can have it! Don't you want it, you pervert!?
Don't call me pervert!
Pervert! Pervert! Silence!
- Pervert!
- Silence!
You asked for it!
Bring it on, you pervert!
It hurts!
Why's blood coming out?
How strange your hair is.
Amazing! How amazing!
Hurts but in a good way!
Mami, come here.
Did I do something wrong?
Torment them for me.
No. Come here. Please.
Thanks.
You're a good girl.
Sister.
Do you hate working with hair now?
Nope! I wanna try even harder.
That's good news.
Mami?
Stay with me forever.
Huh?
Stay with me forever.
Huh?
Stay with me forever.
Sister.
Thanks.
Gossip Girl here, Your one and only source
Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
My mom's filing for divorce. I'd love the chance to talk to her
So she could see for herself just how much I've changed. I should hear your father out.
Really nice seeing your mother up here after all this time. Yeah. Just in time, too, right?
Just in time for what? Your father's parole.
Serena and colin are over. Do not continue To jeopardize her future.
If only he were the only teacher Serena had an inappropriate relationship with.
[dan] serena's in the hospital. Oh, my god.
You drugged her? That was not part of the plan. Look, this isn't just about you anymore.
I was wondering if you wanted to discuss
A place for her recovery. Ostroff center.
Your daughter wakes up alone, drugged,
In an empty motel room, and you just have her committed.
Juliet may have been behind serena's overdose.
What do you say we find that bitch
And get us a little frontier justice? Serena Seeks Support
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.
Synced By YesCool www.addic7ed.com
Spotted--dan and blair exiting sant ambroeus
With espresso doppio for two, but we hear it's not
The caffeine that's got them talking a mile a minute.
It's a mission. So juliet dressed up like serena
At saints and sinners to destroy her relationships With me and nate. And enlists vanessa and jenny to mess with me.
Which is devious and pathetic, but let's face it, Around here, it's just another Saturday night.
Well, you can't show up at a masked ball and not expect
At least one social-climbing doppelganger
To try and impersonate you. But then, according to jenny, juliet posted a photo of herself
As serena doing coke. And for that, she will be judged by a higher power, but we've--
We've seen worse. Well, I was gonna say "done worse," but yes.
Okay, but then... Serena wakes up in a motel room
After almost o.D.Ing.
And that is where the "juliet express" Goes off the rails and heads straight for crazytown.
The next thing we know, serena wakes up, Insists she didn't go on a bender.
But then the photo shows up online, and she starts To doubt herself and checks herself into the ostroff,
Which brings us up to the present.
The thing we need to figure out is why.
I mean, colin, nate, hamilton house-- None of that explains taking things so far.
Well, as someone well-acquainted with the darker human emotions,
Let me offer my theory.
There is only one motive powerful enough to fuel
A gaslighting like this, and that is retribution. Retribution for what? [matt and kim's "am/fm sound" playing]
I know I've already said this,
But I'm really proud of you, and so is mom.
Is that why she's here-- to tell me herself? Do I even wanna know where she is?
She and chuck are meeting with a reporter
From "the post" this morning-- some profile on bass industries. Oh, "the post," because they have such
Award-winning business coverage.
Oh, don't tell me you detect a whiff Of eau de damage control.
Mom's classic scent brings back The fondest memories of childhood. I am way ahead of you there,
But when I confronted her about it, she didn't deny it.
Bass industries is a family-run company,
And like it or not, what the family does
Affects what people think about it.
I know I've put her in a tough position,
But please promise me that you'll try to keep her honest
About where I am and what's going on.
No stories about aunt carol's in miami like when you were here.
I-I am on it, although that marlins jersey
That bart bass bought me that year for christmas
Would look great on you.
[laughs] Serena, eric. Hey.
Have you made a decision? [blair] what do you mean, no visitors?
I don't think you realize who we are.
Who she thinks she is, is more like.
Look, I'm family. I'm serena's brother-- or stepbrother, technically,
Which I do mostly try to put out of my mind Seeing as we dated pretty seriously--
Humphrey, they treat people in here For less serious complexes than that.
Do you wanna get committed? I'll just call her. I'm sure that we're on her list.
And her phone is locked away in a drawer somewhere.
Look, serena's doctor recommended That she start her treatment with 72 hours, no contact.
That includes me, my mom, and you guys. No, but serena doesn't need to be here.
Juliet was behind everything. And we have some questions for her.
Whatever screwy series of events got her in the front door,
She's here now, and she's getting the help
She's probably needed for a long time, So whatever you're up to, you need to do it without serena.
Looks like someone's gonna have a busy holiday season.
Well, unfortunately, they're all followed up By a polite phone call asking if your father will be attending.
Oh. Or in the case of lily's holiday party For bass industries, a handwritten note
Saying she hopes I understand.
Wow, I guess I always thought the mean girls Got a little nicer once they grew up
And had kids of their own. Quite the opposite, I'm afraid.
Yeah. But no party is more important than family.
Yeah. About that... Nate, what is it?
So I really appreciate
Everything you've been doing for dad, and I, you know, Wanna make sure he deserved the chance you're giving him.
So I called the business manager and asked if dad had been
In contact, made any plans for when he got out. Please tell me he didn't book a one-way flight To the caribbean.
No, but he did ask about leasing a house outside the city.
Why wasn't I told about this?
He wanted to tell you.
Dad begged him not to say anything.
I already said you'd find out soon enough.
It was supposed to be a surprise.
I wish I was surprised.
So he uses our addressarole,
Then uses my money to get his own place. Same old howard.
I'm sorry, mom. I understand if you don't wanna go through with this.
I just, you know, I really thought he had changed.
So did I. I'll call the lawyers.
I got you into this mess, okay?
I'll go to dad. I'll tell him.
We can't do nothing for three days.
Who knows how far juliet could get in that time? Yeah, I think we just gotta tell my dad and lily
What juliet did with these pills is against the law.
Police and parents--of course that's your plan, humphrey. Or we could sneak in to see serena.
That receptionist got a pretty good look at me, But maybe with a wig... That's your plan-- disguises and accents?
I never said anything about accents. Can you do any?
No, look, eric is right. We need to leave serena out of this And just find juliet on our own.
Well, colin is her cousin. We could track him down At whatever economic summit he's at this week.
Well, nate dated her. My minions knew her for a whole year
Before we showed up.
Or... There is someone Who seems to know everything about everyone.
Besides me, who?
Gossip girl?
She's not a ouija board, humphrey. You can't just ask, "where's juliet?"
And expect her to point you in the right direction.
Maybe you can.
Look, think about it.
You and serena are her people, not juliet. Serena really could have been hurt, and plus
I'm sure she's furious that juliet sent in that fake photo.
Does she even know that it's fake? [mt.
Desolation's "state of our affairs" playing] # morning wears a veil of rain #
Hey, juliet. It's good to see you. It's been a while.
Yeah, thanks.
It's good to be home. # the traffic's edging forward again #
This is excruciating. What if she doesn't respond And all we're doing is wasting valuable time?
Our time is not that valuable. Until we know where juliet is,
We don't know whether we need to charter a jet
Or if your metro card will suffice for our journey.
[e-mail alert chimes]
That's from her.
Open it. [click]
Well, I guess we have our mission.
[clicking] Buckle up, kids.
You up for a road trip?
Looks like this unholy alliance is hitting the road.
Serena, help me understand.
Are you upset because of what you did Or because you can't remember it?
[sighs] both and...
Neither.
You know, if you saw
A photo of yourself on the internet doing cocaine,
What would you think? I wouldn't know what to think.
I would never do that. Exactly.
But with me, I can't be too sure.
You know, I may not remember kissing dan and nate
Or--or crossing blair, but...
You know, this wouldn't be the first time That I had been with two guys in one night
Or betrayed my best friend. [cork pops] Aah!
That never happened. You're still a man in my eyes. I always knew there was something.
Get out! [serena] things had gotten so out of control,
I didn't know how to pull them back anymore.
Hey, what's happening? Are you okay? We have to go.
No, we can't leave him. There's drugs everywhere.
We can get arrested. [serena] so I left town alone to cornwall, connecticut,
To try to start over.
[engine rumbling] [sighs] is the pedal to the metal?
Because I swear if I shove my feet through the floor,
At least there's no radio, So I'm spared your horrid taste in music.
I think we were supposed to turn there.
You know, I'd tell you to stop being such a backseat driver,
But how can you be one when you don't even know how to drive? I offered to get us a car service--
Professional driver, comfortable seats, champagne!
We're on a mission here.
We need to be able to move at any moment and tail people, Speed, if necessary. Speed?!
And as for tailing someone, A stretch hummer with a hot tub Would be more inconspicuous than this.
First, my dad swapped a '69 les paul for this car. It's a collector's item, and second,
It was either this or the lincoln hawk van, Which, all I'm saying, has graphics.
Fine. We should almost be there. Let me just consult the g.P.S.
No, but for real, cornice should be just up here. [lily] thank you so much for your time.
Enjoy your holiday. We really appreciate
"the post's" interest in the company. Bye. Bye.
That was punishing. I think my face actually hurts from smiling so much. Drink?
It's barely afternoon, but we've earned it. Serena only came up once. Yes, and I kept my promise to eric to tell the truth.
She is exhausted. I know I am.
I think we both killed it. You talking about how proud you are Of the work I've done at the empire.
And you're saying what
A great job I've done leading the board at bass.
Well, I meant what I said. So do I.
Mm, there was that sticky question
Of when I might take back the reins of bass industries.
You kind of flinched when she asked you about it.
Well, I didn't see that it was any of her business.
It's a long ways away, and it was off topic.
I will want it back at some point. You know that, right? Of course.
It was never my intention to be anything More than a custodian, overseeing the board Until you were ready to do it yourself.
I have to get ready for this party,
And the caterers are gonna be here any moment to set up, so...
I'll see you tonight.
Oh. Mwah.
It's a little early in the day for that, don't you think? Things not go well?
No, actually, the interview was, um, fine.
If this is juliet's house,
Then she is even freakier than we thought.
Who pretends to be poor?
Wait a second. I'm not sure what's supposed to happen Right now.
If she is really in there, what's our plan? I mean, what are we gonna do? We're just gonna March up to her
And pull her hair? For starters.
[nelly] # unh, unh, unh, I was thinkin' 'bout her #
# thinkin' 'bout me # [man] take it off. Yeah!
Take it off, baby! # it was only just a dream #
# Oh.
At least he's owning it. [cheering]
# it was only just a dream #
Juliet wouldn't be at a party like this, let alone host it.
I-I don't think this is her house. Well, gossip girl didn't say it was,
So don't just look for juliet.
Look for clues. [boys] body shots!
[indistinct conversations]
Or someone who has one.
# I realize, it was only just a dream #
Damien dalgaard? #
I don't understand. What changed her mind? Found out about the rhinebeck house, dad.
You couldn't even wait two weeks Before you start spending her money? That's what you think?
Nate, your mom and I vacationed at that place When we were first married. She said it was her dream house.
I saw it was for lease and I thought, Wouldn't it be great if we could get out of the city, Just the two of us?
Spend some time reconnecting,
Away from all our so-called friends.
I'm sorry. I might have-- Jumped to conclusions?
I guess this transition's gonna be harder Than we thought. I'll talk to mom.
Don't bother.
I guess you're not the only one who assumed I was incapable Of doing something nice. I was kidding myself.
Two of us alone in the country?
Two of us together at all? It's been over for a long time.
What does that mean when you get out?
I mean...
If you don't come home to mom, are you gonna-- A halfway house? Yes, I am.
Dad, you--
Nate, coming off of two years behind bars? A halfway house sounds pretty good to me.
If you wanna stick around,
I got tv privileges, and, uh, the game is on.
Sure. Okay. [damien] how's your sister?
She's good. She's been living in hudson. I banished her.
Yeah, but it's been for the best. Listen, we're not, uh, here for a reunion.
Yeah, me neither.
I'm working. Connecticut 'burbs Do big business over the holidays.
College kids come home. School is always reliable. School?
Knightley. I went there. Wait.
I didn't make the connection, but of course. When serena ran away,
She went to the knightley school in cornwall.
So do you know juliet sharp?
I do. I saw her in the city about a week ago,
But whatever this is, uh, I'm not getting involved.
Well, if you sold drugs to juliet, then you already are.
It was bad. Serena ended up in the hospital,
And she says she didn't do it to herself.
She will be. [lowered voice] juliet made a pretty big buy, all right?
She bought coke, pills, even some ether.
I assumed she was throwing a party for those sorority girls
At whatever house. Ether? It's like a turn-of-the-century roofie.
So serena goes to boarding school with damien.
Damien sells drugs to juliet. But what's the connection between juliet and serena? You know what?
This is where I first met juliet. She's a townie.
[laughs] whoo!
Oh! [brakes screech, laughter] [boy] whoa!
Watch where you're going, man!
[laughter] [damien] what's the deal with the can opener?
It's a car from britain.
It's not that weird.
I told him we should park away from the house So no one would see us getting in it.
Oh, shotgun, by the way. [tires screech] Whoo!
[engine puttering]
[gossip girl]
better step on it, juliet,
Because your clean getaway just got very messy.
Let the sugar cube melt.
Drop it in. [soulja boy] # soulja boy, I tell 'em #
Extinguish the flame. # hey, I got a new dance for y'all called the soulja boy #
And drink up. # three times from left to right, ahh # Ooh!
[laughs] # soulja boy # Whoo! Oh, check it out.
I love this song. # crank that soulja boy, that superman, that oh #
# crank than soulja, now watch me you #
# crank than soulja, now watch me you #
# crank than soulja, now watch me you # Serena, wh-what do you think about a b-minus?
I want an a-plus. I know. I just think it would seem pretty obvious
If all of a sudden you started getting a's in spanish. I thought we were going for more of a gradual improvement.
You've been studying harder
And working with a-- with a tutor.
[laughs] aw, my tutor.
[giggles]
# ahh, you # [knock on window]
Mrs. Sharp.
Hi. Uh, we're juliet's friends from new york.
Is, uh, is she around? Oh. [chuckles] um, no, no, she's out running some errands for me.
I see.
Um, I guess we'll-- we'll try again later.
Or maybe we can come in and wait?
We've been dying to see her, and it was a long ride.
Um, sure. [chuckles] sure. Come on in.
Well, what did you say your names were? Oh, we didn't. I'm blair.
This is dan and damien. I'll put the kettle on.
You guys sit.
Um, so do you go to columbia with jules, or... I do. Oh.
Um, but dan goes to n.Y.U., And damien's in the school of life.
I actually know juliet from here.
I went to knightley. Oh.
Uh, so I-I assume you know our ben.
He was a damn good teacher, no matter what they say.
I don't remember a mr. Sharp. No, no, his last name is donovan--
The same as my first husband.
Do you recognize him?
[lowered was julies brother.
[lowered voice] well, if I taught at knightley,
I wouldn't bring my "mystic pizza" townie family To school events either.
When serena went back to the city, He got fired for sleeping with a student.
Everyone was sure it was her.
Is, uh, earl grey okay?
Actually, we won't be able to stay.
So you're at a new school, but it's the same old thing-- Partying, boys.
Yeah, but there was one person there who was different.
Mr. Donovan, hey. If you're wondering,
No, I don't plan to drink both of these coffees.
One is actually for you.
It's, uh, with two creams and no sugar.
I notice that's how you take it in the dining hall.
Thank you.
Um, so if you don't mind, I was, um, wondering, I actually have some questions about arbor imagery
In the poems of sylvia plath.
Well, I happen to know that will be on the final next week. So, uh, will you sit down?
[chuckles] Thank you.
Yeah, of course. [serena]
it felt good to have someone Who paid attention to me for a positive reason,
And we began to spend more and more time together.
There wasn't a keg cracked within 10 miles
That serena didn't know about, d then suddenly,
She started staying home, reading in her room.
The generous conclusion to draw would be that serena Was getting her act together, focusing on school.
Yeah, but no one thought that. They assumed she was sleeping
With the handsome, young english teacher. Was she? Well, I always thought the best about serena, but--
But something made you believe it was true.
I was having dinner with my aunt at the millbrook inn
In poughkeepsie. [thunder crashes]
[laughing] Oh. [laughs]
[damien] as we were heading out, I saw serena
Checking in with mr. Donovan.
Uh, I-I can't believe we got a flat tire in that weather. A trip to the mary mccarthy collection At the vassar library is so not worth it.
[laughs] Ah.
Why don't you, uh, dry off and get something to eat?
And I'll go take care of that car.
What? Are you kidding?
You're not going back out there.
You'll drown.
The tire's not gonna fix itself.
Yeah, but it'll stop raining by morning.
Maybe we could... Get a room. Serena...
The ability to have thoughts and not act on them--
It's what separates man from beast.
You're not gonna quote your way out of this.
I know what the stakes are for you. For me, too. But this is real on both sides,
And if you deny it, you're lying. I'm not a liar.
I'm not gonna deny anything.
I care about you very much, serena...
Which is why I'm going to brave the weather and fix the tire
So I can drive you home
So you can sleep in your own bed tonight.
[thunder crashing]
You know, I think he was the only guy
To ever say no to me.
I was in love with him. Well, as in love as I had ever been at that point.
After that, I didn't know how to act around him,
So... We, uh, we never really talked again. This must have been
Very disappointing to the 16-year-old adventuress
That you were at the time, But when you tell this story now,
What does it make you think? That ben donovan was a pretty great guy.
[phone rings] Hey. Finally.
[juliet] what do you need, ben?
What's with the mood? Mom wear you out christmas shopping?
No, we actually never made it to the mall. Dan and blair showed up in cornwall with damien dalgaard.
Damien?
What's he doing with them?
Well, considering he's the one who sold me the pills
That I used on serena, I think I have a pretty good guess.
Look, I told you the drugs were going too far. Never mind if they go to the cops.
What if those guys show up at mom's And start asking questions? Yeah, I'm sure they already did.
And I'm sure they're figuring it all out right now,
Which is exactly why I am gonna finish this thing
Once and for all like I should have done in the first place.
Where are you?
Are you in the city?
Juliet... You have done enough.
Do not go after serena. If you touch her--
What?
It's not like you can stop me.
[beep]
Hey, I-I need to make another call.
Please, you've got to let me make a call. Okay, fine, you make the call, but someone has to warn her.
Serena van der woodsen.
Hey, archibald! I'm ben.
I'm juliet's brother.
All right, you need to find serena and make sure she's okay. Wait, wait. What?
Hey! Hey, man.
You gotta back up from the bars, man.
You can't talk to him, okay? Hey, man, what's up?
[nate] hey, when's the last time you talked with serena?
She's not answering her phone. No, they took it away. It's part of her therapy.
Oh, so she's still at the ostroff? That's good. I guess she's safe there.
Safe from what?
I was visiting my dad, and I ran into juliet's brother ben?
He was really upset, and he, uh, seemed to think
Serena's in danger. From--from who?
Juliet? I don't know. He didn't get a chance to say.
But, uh, we should probably go check on her. Can you go?
I'm in staten island.
No, I'm... [sighs]
I'm with blair and damien in connecticut. It's a long story, but... All right, meet us at the van der woodsens'.
Serena should be okay where she is,
But we--we need to find juliet.
Okay, I'll see you there.
[twilight sleep's "architect 10.20 mix" playing] # [click]
[gossip girl] uh-oh, s.
You've got a surprise visitor, And she's about to give you shock therapy.
Look, I think I figured it out.
Okay, serena had an affair with her teacher Because, let's face it.
It's serena, And what else is there to do in connecticut?
Then she came to her senses and discarded him
Like last season's chanel booties. Then he became a crazy stalker, and serena pressharges.
That should be a warning to you, humphrey. Yeah, because the parallels are striking.
Never-to-be-realized literary aspirations--check.
Townie--you're from brooklyn, so check.
And giving up everything to become Serena van der woodsen's stalker--check.
Face it, humphrey. You are one knitted tie away from mr.
Donovan territory. Yeah, except for the fact that stalker implies one-sided.
Serena went to the saints and sinners ball
Because she chose me. Yes, it was obvious this morning at the ostroff center That serena couldn't wait to be in your arms.
And for the record, I haven't given anything up To be with serena.
Oh, of course not... Besides your time and your dignity.
You are chauffeuring me around, aren't you? And I'm just curious.
When was the last time you wrote anything?
And scribbling "d. Loves s."
All over your journal every night doesn't count. [serena] and the photo of me on "gossip girl"--
That was you, too? Yep.
I went out dressed like you
And partied like it was 2007. And then you just left me for dead in a motel room--
Why? Because of nate or colin?
No, you stupid bitch, Because you destroyed my brother's life.
Who's your brother? Ben donovan.
Ben is your brother? Wh-what did I ever do to him?
[scoffs] The official charge is statutory rape
And transporting a minor across state lines. But nothing happened.
The girl signed an affidavit stating otherwise.
I can't believe serena would do this.
Okay. So I prove my innocence in court.
It's her word against mine.
I have to advise against going to trial.
They have a witness that saw you at the bed and breakfast.
You left campus with an underage student And drove across state lines.
To a library. I know.
It's a bitter pill, but the girl's family
Doesn't want the story to get out either, So they pressured the d.A.
Into offering a plea bargain.
They can do that?
Serena's from a powerful family. And we're nobodies.
A plea bargain keeps the case out of the papers
And keeps your name off the national sex offenders list.
You can start over again.
After I serve time for a crime I didn't commit.
I'm sorry, ben. Thanks to you, My brother's currently serving a 5-year sentence.
I swear, I never accused ben of any crime.
He was nothing but good to me.
I saw the affidavit. I didn't sign anything. Then who did?
[man] lily! The party's lovely.
Thank you. Now tell me, honestly, how is serena doing?
Oh, she's fine. She just needed a breather, And if it were up to me,
She would be at canyon ranch right now, but they were booked. Actually, my sister needs more than a hot stone massage
To get better, but she's on her way to a full recovery.
I'm sorry, But that was what serena wanted, and you know it. Eric, somewhere between a marlins jersey
And the absolute truth lies the better part of decorum.
Becoming an adult is about learning the distinction. [indistinct conversations] [jazz version of "here we come a-wassailing" playing]
[anne] you're doing some very exciting things, I hear. I appreciate that. Mom, hey.
Oh, sweetheart, hi. Well, looks like lily heard the divorce is back on.
Look, I messed up. The house dad rented--
It was this place in rhinebeck
You guys went on your first vacation. He really did want to surprise you.
I'm afraid it doesn't change anything. But it's not his fault,
And now he's gonna have to go to a halfway house. I'm sorry, nate.
It was never gonna work. We were all just fooling ourselves.
[woman] hi, anne!
The truth is, I need this more than I need your father.
Minnie, hi. Hi. How are you?
Is that one of your designs?
It is. Oh! You look adorable.
Thank you. Come. [laughs]
[clink] Good evening.
On behalf of bass industries, I'd like to wish you all a very happy holiday.
I'd also like to acknowledge my stepmother And all the work she's done for the company. [applause]
I'm gonna go talk to my mom. Okay.
[lily] when charles asked me to take over, I was overwhelmed. Serena will explain. But he's family, and I've tried to do what's best
For my family. It's the one thing that has always guided me.
[gasps] Serena!
What a lovely surprise.
Everything okay? I need to talk to you. Okay.
Well, let's just take a few photos real quick. Smile.
What's going on?
I don't know, but I feel a little sick inside
And not just because I'm looking at him.
What, have you come to recruit another virgin To be your drug mule?
I would say, "why, are you available?" But I'm leaving.
Thanks for the ride into the city.
[serena] okay, that's enough.
Thanks for helping. [lily] just one more. I can't do this.
I'm lily's daughter.
I wasn't gonna be able to make it tonight Because, um, I was actually at the ostroff center.
But if it were up to my mother,
She'd have you believe that I was at canyon ranch. That's because having a daughter who's in a mental hospital
Threatens her carefully protected image.
She wants you all to think that she's the perfect host
And mother and wife, but the truth is
She's a selfish liar who will destroy anyone Who stands in her way.
Time to turn on the charm, lily,
Because your perfect party just turned into the perfect storm.
I apologize.
I told serena she couldn't take
The company plane to belize for christmas break,
And apparently, she took it harder than I realized. #
[lowered voice] go find out What's going on with your sister.
Please, rufus, take the holiday to get things under control. With the upcoming sale of bass industries,
We don't need any more surprises. Lily said she told you.
Of course. Forgive me.
Um, it's been a dizzying few days.
Look, I don't know what's going on,
But serena brought juliet here tonight.
[instrumental "we wish you a merry christmas" playing] Don't take one step closer to her.
How do you feel about prison food
And daily strip searches? B., it's okay. I talked to juliet.
She's not the problem anymore. It's my mom.
Well, clearly, she's drugged serena again.
Dan, write a list of everything Damien said that he sold to juliet, and, you, Look at the list and tell us which one of those drugs
Causes you to repeatedly trust psychopaths. And you call the police.
Okay, nobody is calling the police. I know everything that juliet did,
And nothing excuses it,
But the van der woodsens are not putting any more Of her family members behind bars.
Juliet, I'll find a way to get ben out of prison, I promise.
You're free to go now. What? No!
No, this is unacceptable.
Juliet has tried to hurt you too many times.
You can't just let her walk away. Blair's right, serena.
I promise I won't do anything to harm serena again,
Or anyone else for that matter. [nate]
yeah, that's reassuring. I'm sorry.
I just spent a day
In a... Car with dan humphrey to try to track her down,
And you're just letting her leave.
I really need someone to tell me what's going on. Okay, look, I'll explain everything to everyone. I just need to talk to my mom first.
It seems that my biological children
Don't understand that when business is at stake,
You need to leave your dirty laundry in the hamper.
Is that what ben donovan was to you--dirty laundry? Who's ben donovan?
He was my boarding school teacher.
Mom falsely accused him of statutory rape,
So now he's serving time for a crime he didn't commit.
Is that what the ostroff center calls treatment these days? Public scenes and false accusations?
Juliet is ben's sister.
She told me everything. So, please, no more lying.
What happened? You wanted to come home, and I wanted you here.
But when constance saw your records from knightley,
They wouldn't take you back, and it was the same With all the decent schools. And I-I was worried
About your future, so I went to knightley And talked to the administration.
Of course you did.
Well, when I was on campus,
There were some girls gossiping about you. They said that you had spent the night
At a bed and breakfast with one of your teachers.
That was just gossip. Well, it was gossip I could use to our advantage.
I expressed my concern to the school
That one of their teachers was having
An inappropriate relationship with my underage daughter.
So you sent ben to prison so that I could go to constance? Well, no! O-of course not.
But after I left, the school... Alerted the authorities, And then I didn't know what I had set in motion
Until I was contacted by the d.A., And by then, it was too late. What, too late to tell the truth?
So you just destroy a man's life, All so that you can keep up appearances?
No, I did this for you, for your future. Look, it's not like mr. Donovan was guilt-free.
He--he shouldn't have been having an affair with a student.
But he didn't do anything.
Nothing ever happened.
Serena, you don't have to protect him. I'm not protecting him.
He never touched me, mom.
You sent an innocent man to prison. Look, everyone here has crossed the line at some point To protect someone they care about.
It's not so easy when you're the collateral damage. Maybe it's time to put everything on the table.
Lily, do you have something you need to tell chuck?
Well, if there was something I wanted to tell charles,
I would have told him.
Lily's selling bass industries.
It's all very complicated.
I had to talk to the board first.
I trusted you with my father's company.
I want it back... Immediately.
Do you really think the board would allow me to give The company to someone who just disappeared for three months? Your instability is the reason that I ended up in charge
Serena, I'm so sorry.
Please believe me.
You have to.
I don't have to do anything for you ever again.
I...
I didn't wanna hurt anyone, rufus. I really thought I was helping.
I'm sorry, lily.
I-I don't know that I believe that anymore.
They say you reap what you sow.
Better get out your gardening gloves, lily. Looks like you're going to have a bumper crop this year.
[the rosebuds' "oh it's christmas" playing]
See, I told ya, Food is more delicious when you cook it yourself.
Yep, that's why we're gonna end this experiment
In middle class living and call housekeeping to clean up.
No way!
I stuck my hand up a turkey's butt. You're not getting out of your job.
Well, I provided the location, so I did my part. Now I'm off to new zealand to enjoy a taste of summer
And girls who like sex games in the rain forest. Well, I'll help clear. It's only fitting,
Seeing as I did the shopping, set the table,
And oversaw the cooking. All right. [cell phone rings, beep]
Yeah, but he's driving out on his own. See? I told you road trips are strictly for humphreys.
Since my mom isn't going to help get ben out of jail,
I wanna find the judge whose name is on the affidavit.
I think that he lives upstate, so I thought I'd turn it
Into a road trip.
Why don't you come with me?
Uh, how long were you thinking?
Well, I have to be back by the time school starts.
I called dean reuther and explained that It wasn't me that dropped out. She was not happy,
But she did reinstate me. Good-bye, friends, dan.
I'll see you in the new year.
Wait. I'll, uh, I'll walk you out.
Here. #
New zealand? That's awfully close to australia.
You know me.
I like the heat.
Well, you'll get plenty of it if you try to make a deal
With the devil. Jack will never help you.
Maybe, but a shared enemy makes for unlikely friends.
You ready?
[elevator bell dings] # oh it's christmas #
Happy holidays, blair. # [utensils clattering]
I'm sorry to just spring a road trip
On you like that.
I didn't even ask what your plans for the break were.
Oh, no, I don't really have any plans. I was... Sort of hoping to hang out with you
And... Go see some movies, maybe get some writing done. Well, then why don't you come with me?
You could still write. Come on. It would be so much fun.
It would be just the two of us listening to the radio And eating roadside food and do a little recon along the way. What do you say?
But it feels like this trip
Is something you might need to do on your own.
I've been trying so hard to prove to the world
That I've changed.
But I think the person that doubted the most was me.
I'm gonna work on that.
And you'll succeed. I know you will. I mean, I know you better than anyone.
[kisses]
Be safe.
[diddy-dirty money] # tell the world I'm coming home #
# let the rain wash away #
Whenever we give up something we really care about,
We hope that the universe
Will reward our selfless choice. Ho, ho, ho! Hey, dad, how's it going?
I've done some research On my options for halfway houses,
And some of them aren't too bad.
I mean, after prison, It's not like I need the four seasons.
What about the empire? What do you mean? Well, I spoke with the parole board.
I gave them my address as where you'll be reporting in January.
I want you to come back to a home. Thank you, nate.
I can't tell you how much this means to me.
Well, I'm out buying you some new clothes.
I know you've been locked away for a while, But no one's wearing orange this season.
[laughs]
However, it's not always fate that gives us a gift.
Sometimes it's someone closer to home.
What are you still doing here? Shouldn't you be off living your dream-- Days on end in a real car with serena?
No, I'm staying here, so actually,
I'll be living out my nightmare,
Trapped in the city with only blair waldorf to talk to. Nate's here.
I'll share custody as long as I'm in first position.
No, nate's with his grandfather. Eric, then. Gstaad with elliot.
Please don't continue down the list. I promise you, it's just me. I won't be calling.
I'm gonna be very busy writing, Turning vanessa's room into an office,
Seeing "nénette" at the film forum.
I'm seeing "nénette" at film forum. You like french documentaries about orangutans? "nénette" is an inspiration.
Last summer, I'd go to the jardin des plantes
All the time just to visit her.
If we happen to run into each other, Please don't sit next to me.
I wouldn't think of it.
Let's just finish these dishes so we can go home, all right? I'll wash. You dry.
This coming from the one holding what appears to be
A bottle of I'occitane shampoo. You can't wash good wineglasses in common dish soap.
Just follow my lead, humphrey.
You're used to doing that. # coming home, tell the world that I'm coming home #
Excuse me.
Synced By YesCool www.addic7ed.com
Could you please just tell me what's going on?
My mom and sister are out of town, So I know they aren't visiting. # thank you lord, I'm coming home #
# I'm coming home #
Serena.
What are you doing here?
I had to come see you. # all the pain of yesterday #
I don't know what to say.
Neither do I.
But I feel like I should start. If you love someone, set them free.

Piece of shit!
Fuck you. All right. Can I borrow your cell phone?
I don't have one.
- Just...
- It's brain cancer. There's a pay phone
- over there by the bathroom. - No, it can wait.
What's happening with you?
I used to think you had the world by the balls.
Now, I'm not sure if you even got any.
I got them when I need them, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, smart and funny.
What I always admired about you, your wit.
- You're a prick, Andy. - I always was.
- So, let's see if there're any left. - What?
Cojones.
Well, you need money. So do I. Let's solve it.
- What are you talking about? - Well, there's a place we can knock off.
Know it like the back of our hand. Easiest money you'll ever get.
What are you saying?
It's worth about 600 grand.
And it's insured, so it's a victimless crime.
I offer that in case your faggoty little conscience bothers you.
I weigh it off on 20 cents on the dollar.
That's 60 grand each.
Give or take.
I can't believe this is you that's talking.
Believe it.
So, it's safe, nobody gets hurt, everybody wins. It's perfect.
Why?
What do...
- Do you need money? - Of course, I need money. But this is...
This is serious crime, Andy. I'm not a serious crime kind of a guy. I got a kid...
You've got shit.
You have a whole lot of shit. You said so yourself.
All the time. Every day.
You know what? It's not as serious as you might think.
You're my little brother. Now, trust me.
God, Andy.
That's why you called me up?
That's why you wanted to spend the night together,
- talk me into something crazy? - That's why I called you up.
(LAUGHlNG)
Talk you into something crazy.
Well, what's the place?
No, not another word till you commit.
Fuck.
It's all right.
So, how's the wife?
(INCOHERENT CHATTERlNG)
Hey, Hank.
Hey, I got an appointment.
- I'll be back in a few, all right. - Of course, you will. It's Thursday.
- You're early. - Well...
You know my days are so busy.
Just tell me that you'll think about it.
But I thought about it already.
And I came to the conclusion that you're crazy.
I'm going to go where with you?
I mean, you've got child support.
You've got Danielle's school, you've got the rent... (GROANlNG)
- The mortgage...
- Come on. ...you're up to your ears in debt, Hank.
- I can solve all that. I know I can.
When are you going to grow up, Hank?
We have a really good thing going, and you should just enjoy it.
We have a really good time in bed. I don't ask for anything.
I love you. I want more.
So does Oliver Twist.
Can I help you to seconds?
Or do you really, really, really have to get back?
Huh?
"The weight of this sad time we must obey.
"Speak what we feel and not what we ought to say.
"The oldest hath borne most.
"We that are young shall never see so much,
"nor live so long."
HANK:
(WHOOPlNG) Bravo! Bravo!
(CHEERlNG)
You were great. I'm so proud of you.
You were wonderful.
Grandpa and I thought you were wonderful.
Excuse me, I'm sorry. It's just... I have to have your autograph.
- Dad. No. - What, you were incredible.
- No, stop it. - What?
- I messed up some of my lines. - No, you didn't. I didn't notice.
- Did you notice? - I didn't notice at all.
Honey, you were great. What?
Mom, can I go see The Lion King this weekend?
- There's a class trip, everyone's going. - Did you ask your father?
- Can I, Dad? - Yeah, sure. I got some money.
Well, it's $130.
But we're staying overnight and that includes hotel and everything.
Okay, great. Yeah.
(PHONE RlNGS)
- Yeah. - Hey, man. Can I talk to you?
- ANDY: Where are you? - I'm down the hall, by the coffee.
- How about my office, 30 seconds? - HANK: All right.
Hank, the super at 111 Riverside says the boiler's really kaput.
He needs you to... Hello?
So?
- That place that you were talking about. - What place?
- The one that we were going to...
- To knock off?
Yeah.
To rob?
You say it.
Tell me about it.
I'm not going to tell you about it until you say you're in and once you say it, there's no way out.
I'm in.
Let me see your hands.
- Just say it again, "I'm in." - What're you talking about?
Just say it again, "I'm in."
I'm in.
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)
What?
I just wanted to see if you were pulling any of that chickenshit baby stuff
like when we were kids, you know,
"It doesn't count. I had my fingers crossed."
I'm in. What're we doing?
- And when? - It's a jewelry store.
- Does this ring a bell? - No.
What if I tell you it's got a Foot Locker on one side and a Claire's Accessories on the other.
Yeah, that's right. You got it. Now, listen.
We don't want Tiffany's.
We want a Mom and Pop operation, in a busy place, on a Saturday when the week's takes go in the safe.
We both worked there. We know the safe combinations.
We know the burglar alarm signals. We know where everything is.
I figure, between the week's take, the jewelry and the cases, the vault, there's a $500,000 haul.
I figure probably six.
That old dumb old lady that works there, she's alone till noon.
She's not going to be a problem.
Andy.
Yeah?
That's Mom and Dad's store.
That's what I said.
A Mom and Pop operation.
- You can't do that. - Yeah, we can. Think about it.
It's perfect. It's perfect.
In and out in a minute.
Insurance takes care of Mom and Dad, so they're not hurt. Right?
No one's going to give a shit.
After a week the cops
- will put it in the back of the filing cabinet. - Jesus, Andy. I...
Why did you even want me in on this?
Well, it'll solve everything for both of us.
What has to be solved for you?
Same as you. I need money. I'm going to start over again.
What do you mean?
What the fuck kind of... It's none of your business.
I just want out. I just want to... That's all.
I'm getting out, I want to help my little brother.
Come on.
Yeah.
No, I don't think I can do this. I don't think I can...
Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can.
I just...
That's $2,000.
It's an advance.
See what just that much does for you.
And, imagine the rest.
HANK: Five, six, seven, eight, nine hundred dollars.
You still owe me May and June.
Yeah, Monday. All right. Everything on Monday.
- That's what I said. - Such a loser.
You're such a fucking loser.
I come over here with $900.
- Yeah, well, if it was for me, maybe. - And I'm the fucking... All right.
- May and June, asshole. - Bye, bye, bye.
Danielle, dinner.
No, please don't put me on... Jesus.
- Yo, Bobby. - What's going on?
- Hey, here, let me buy you a drink. - I'm working.
- I ain't loaning you no more money. - No, come on, man. I'm flush.
- You don't exactly...
- Yeah, something like that.
Look, you just... If you're free tomorrow morning,
I got a proposition for you.
- Later. - All right.
- What if there is a security guard? - There isn't.
- Why? - No, it's a Mom and Pop place.
Who ever heard of a Mom and Pop jewelry store?
- What the fuck is that? - It's in the suburbs, all right.
It's not in the city.
I don't know.
We drive out there, we check it out, if anything looks off, you know, we just drive away.
We say, "Fuck it," we drive our happy asses home and I keep the money anyway.
Yeah, fine.
You keep the money anyway.
- Hanson? - Yeah, that's me.
All right.
- Yeah. - Bobby, for Christ's sakes,
- Bobby, we got to go. - Just come on in.
I just got to throw on some clothes. It'll only take a second.
We got to go.
- (SHUSHlNG) Just give me a second. - God damn it.
Jesus Christ, Bobby, it's so fucking early.
Boo wakes up, you fucking sit up with him.
- I told you it was work. - I don't give a fuck what it is.
Chris ain't used to getting up this early.
Oh, Christ.
Come on, babe. Here.
- Thank you, baby. - Yeah, just keep it down, okay?
You wake Boo up, I'll kick your ass.
- All right. - Yours, too.
All right.
Come on.
All right, let's do it.
(MUSlC PLAYlNG ON RADlO)

All right.
(LAUGHS)
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?
Look, I used to work there, all right.
I used to work there and I can't take a chance on being recognized. Don't...
Look... (BOBBY LAUGHlNG)
- You ain't never done this before, huh? - Yeah, so?
I got to tell you something, you look like a fucking asshole.
- Yeah, all right, look...
- I'm going to do this on my own.
- Really? - You do the driving, I do the thing, all right.
- What if you need help? - I got all the help I need.
There's no shooting.
- I ain't looking for it. - There's no shooting.
- You do the driving. - Hey.
- I do the thing. - No shooting.
You ain't got the balls to do the thing. I got the balls
- and I got a gun. That's the deal. - Listen, no shooting.
- Or else I'm leaving right now. - Hey, no!
Just no shooting, okay?

It just came apart, Andy.
HANK: Oh, my God, Andy.
What the fuck am I gonna do?
No, honey, no, don't worry. It's just some mistake.
It's either the bank's or mine.
Maybe I didn't put enough money in the joint account.
Yeah. No. Listen, don't worry.
Of course, we have the cash. I'll call, I'll take care of it. Okay?
Yes, okay?
(KNOCKlNG ON DOOR)

We're waiting for you in the conference room.
Okay, I'll be right in.
Jesus.
Okay, next.
The auditors.
Some of you guys might have heard, we're getting hit with an IRS audit.
The auditors will be here on Monday.
They'll spend a day or two with each department.
On Monday, they'll start with payroll, so you're up first, Andy.
Great. Great. No problem.
MAN: How are you doing today, sir?
Thanks a lot.
(DOORBELL RlNGlNG) (TV BLARlNG)
Hungry?
Have a drink.
Right, tonic water.
You know, the thing about real estate accounting is that you can, you can head down the page or across the page, and everything works out.
So, every day, everything adds up.
Well, the total is always the sum of its parts.
It's clean, it's clear, neat, absolute.
But my life, it...
It doesn't add up. It's...
Nothing connects to anything else. It's...
I'm not the sum of my parts.
All of my parts don't add up to one...
To one me, I guess.
Get a shrink or a wife.
- I got a wife. - Get a shrink.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Was it me, honey?
What difference does it make?
It's another strikeout.
I swear it would make a lot of difference.
- You're all I want. - Yeah, well...
I'm a lousy cook. The house looks like shit.
I'm a lousy lay, I don't know why you wanna keep me.
You weren't in Rio.
I wasn't what?
Lousy lay.
Well, like you said, just blame it on Rio.
Suppose I could get us back there.
What?
Rio.
- To live? - Absolutely.
- You're just crazy. Crazy. - No.
The real estate market's booming in Rio. There's a lot of new money.
And they're going to want the same as Europeans, Arabs, everybody wants real estate in New York, in America and I know the market here.
You don't even speak the language.
I'll fucking learn it. Jesus Christ.
You know when...
When you met me, my biggest prospect was inheriting a Mom and Pop jewelry store in a fucking shopping mall in Westchester.
Now, I know it's not Trump Plaza, and...
But just take a look at how we're living now.
Now, I took that lousy job in that, that real estate office, I was practically a fucking gofer, and I'm pulling down six figures now.
I know the angles.
- Yeah. - Yeah.
I bet you do.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Well, because there is no extradition agreement between Brazil and the United States.
How the...
How the hell do you know that?
I saw it in a movie.
(LAUGHlNG)
Yeah, I guess I saw the same movie.
So, what are you thinking? What are you thinking?
What are you thinking? What are you thinking?
Don't ask, don't tell.
I just want us to get back there.
I've seen Heaven, Gina, it's a nice place to stay.
- Okay? All right? - Uh-huh.
- What language do they speak there? - Portuguese.
I speak a little Spanish.
(LAUGHS)
That's... I'm sorry, sweetheart, that's not the same language.
- Yes, it is. - I'm sorry, it's not.
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is. - No.
- Yes, it is. - Cómo se llama?
- Me llamo... - Cómo? Me llamo...

You're a cop.
No, I'm not a cop, I just want to make sure you're still around.
I'll bring you what I've got soon, either you take it or you don't.
But I know you will.
You could work for the cops.
Check me out.
I'll be back.
(ELECTRONlC BUZZlNG)
That's $2,000.
It's an advance.
See what just that much does for you, and imagine the rest.
(LAUGHlNG)
- Yeah, so how do we start? Oh, fuck.
- It's not we, you.
Me?
What the hell do I know about robbing a jewelry store?
You'll learn it there. On-the-job training, you know.
Cut it out, man, this is serious.
You know, I'm serious as a heart attack. Listen, number one, I can't...
- I can't go up to the mall. - Why not?
Oh God, three months ago,
I had to walk the whole goddamn area with a Home Depot representative,
'cause they were thinking of buying up a lot of space.
We own a lot of land in the mall, and I'm getting a lot of big handshakes.
"I haven't seen you in so long since you left."
And telling me all that bullshit because they figure I'm making a killing, because a big chain wants to buy them out.
I'm saying someone's going to just recognize me too easy.
So we postpone, just...
Yeah, we could, you know, wait a year.
I mean, I don't know about you, my problems are pressing.
Jesus, Andy, I... Andy!
- I wouldn't even know how to start, I mean. - Well, you can stop being a baby.
- I'm not being a...
- Yeah, you're being a baby.
Get a gun. You get a toy gun in a kid's store.
Right, that old lady that works on Saturday, what's her name?
- Doris? - Yeah, Doris, Mom's friend.
She's what, 60, 70? She's blind as a bat?
Look at me. Blind as a bat.
All right, those toy guns, they look so real, they fool cops all the time.
All right, you go in at 8:00 a.m., just as she opens up.
You put her old ass in the back room, you empty the vault, the cash, the trays and you dump it in a fucking sack.
All right. You don't gotta be neat about it.
Jesus, Andy, I don't know. I don't know, I don't... I...
I don't know.
Okay. Come on.
You can do it.
You can do it.
Anybody can.
- I just think...
- I know, I know. It's too late to think.
It's too late.
This is our future.
Okay.

He sounds like some nut case. But...
Okay, I got it.

Oh, my God, Andy.

HANK: Could he be in a different wing?
If you just pipe down a second, sir, I'm trying to help you.
- What are you doing here? - Keep quiet one minute.
Dad called me, all right. I just got here.
- This lady, she doesn't...
- Look, Miss, our father... I got it.
- I got it. I know, but you might...
- I told him, we've got no Charles Hanson.
Wait a minute, I got a Nanette Hanson.
- What? - There's a Nanette Hanson.
- Brought in about three hours ago. - What?
Gunshot wounds.
- Where is she? - Emergency ICU.
Hey. Now. Hey, hold it.

She's...

They say...
MARTHA: So, how are you feeling?
Yeah, I feel old.
I've been studying all week, and I can't retain a thing.
Come on, you're going to pass with flying colors, Dad.
That's how I'm going to spend my birthday, taking that stupid test.
Have you spoken to your brothers?
Few weeks ago.
CHARLES: Yeah? How are they?
Busy.
You know, Dad, Hank is Hank and Andy's Andy.
No more cramming, birthday boy. It's the moment of truth.
What time is Doris coming to the store?
She said 12:00 at the latest.
She has to baby-sit for her daughter.
I'll pick you up right after my test.
Come on, come on.
All right, all right, all right.
- Perfect score, Mr. Hanson. - Bingo!
(LAUGHlNG)
Congratulations.
If you'll take this to Window C, they'll give you the eye test.
I might not do so well on that one.
- I've been studying hard, of course. Thanks. - All right.

I love you.
There are more tests we can do, but from what we've seen so far, it's very unlikely.
There's no brain activity.
And statistically speaking, there's very little chance for recovery.
ANDY: Why was Mom working?
I thought she didn't work at the store anymore, that's what Katherine told me.
Doris had to baby-sit, I had to get down to the DMV, get my eyes tested.
Today's my birthday.
Where's your brother?
He...
He says he can't take it. To let him know if...
If he can help, but he just can't see her like that.
He's 28 years old.
He's a goddamn punk from Red Hook.
Red Hook. What was he doing up here? What in the fucking world?
I mean, did he put a map on the wall and throw a dart?
It's so absurd. It's so goddamn arbitrary.
Why me? Why her?
What was this goddamn kid doing?
You belong in hell.
Yeah. I understand. All right.
Look, it might be better if you call, make an appointment?
Well, I'd rather wait.
Please. Steve...
Dad.
You have to make a decision, Dad.
The gun was bought in Texas.
Stolen Texas driver's license, his ID, fake, the gun turns up in New York, a year later.
- Mom needs you to make a decision, Dad. - Andy, just leave him alone.
Well, something has to be done, he has to make a decision.
Just leave him to his grief for one minute.
- Mom is in the hands of Jesus. - Now, will you cut it out with that crap?
You shouldn't push Dad to make a decision he doesn't wanna make.
Well, he has to make a decision.
Hey, Patrick.

"Because God has chosen to call Nanette from this life,
"commit her body to the earth, for we are dust and to dust we shall return."
I'm so sorry for your loss. She was a wonderful person.

- I'm so sorry. - You have my deepest condolences.

You know, I mean, there's going to be other field trips.

No.
Excuse me, can I get a beer? Thanks.
(SlGHlNG)
CHRlS: That's the guy, that's him.
Yo, buddy.
- This guy? - Yeah.
You were with Bobby Lasorda, Saturday?
- What? - I asked you a fucking question.
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What's your name? - I'm Hank.
- Hank what? - You know what?
Come. Why don't you... Let's go.
Follow me, we can talk over here.
- Come on. Have a seat. - Is this all right?
Yeah, this is perfect.
So...
What's the deal, huh?
- My sister is quite all of a sudden a widow. - Yeah.
She says you and Bobby had some work.
Bobby said it was work.
Work that involved him getting shot and killed, but not you getting shot and killed.
No, I just got him the car.
- I'm so sorry. - What the fuck does that mean?
Well, Bobby said that he needed to rent a car, but that he...
This was Friday night and he didn't have a credit card, so I told him that I would rent him a car.
And I owed him some money. You know. That's it, I swear.
I'm so sorry.
- So what? You're lying. - No, I'm not.
Because if Bobby wanted a car, he would have fucking stolen one.
Chris, go fucking wait outside.
Let me handle this.
You got a driver's license?
- A what? - You know, the...
The driver's license you show when you rent a car?
Yeah.
- Let me see it. - Yeah.
All right, sure.
Here.
- Henry Hanson. - Yeah.
This is your address, right?
Yeah, sure.
I'm going to be straight with you, chico.
You mind if I call you chico?
People call me Hank.
Bobby was a piece of shit.
I know it, you know it. That's not the point.
The point is that piece of shit was the father of my sister's child.
And he was paying the bills.
And now he's dead.
And I'm thinking, who's going to pay all these bills?
I'm so sorry.
Sorry ain't going to pay the bills, chico.
I know, I know.
We need to negotiate a settlement, so make me an offer.
Ten grand, done.
It's 10 grand. I consider us even.
If you don't like 10, I can make it 15.
- No. - My sister wants me to kill you.
Or I could call the cops.
But I don't like cops.
And the cops ain't going to pay my sister's bills.
So, I think a settlement is pretty fair all-around.
- Day after tomorrow, chico. - Can I?
Here. 8:00.
You fucking crazy?
I was hoping that you had something left over from the settlement.
Lend you money? You owe me $2,000.
Shocked to shit you'd even ask.
Martha,
I'm in serious trouble.
I don't give a shit what kind of trouble you're in.
The next time you show up here, better be to pay me.
Listen, tell Danielle I love her.
If you loved her, you'd pay her fucking child support.
(CAR ALARM BLARlNG)
MAN: I'm so sorry for your loss. She was a wonderful person.
Wonderful woman.
She was a wonderful woman.
God bless you.
There's no way I can make this scene, Andy.
He was always such a baby.

- Hey, Gina. - I can't really talk right now.
Andy needs me. I got to go.
Gina, Gina.
Excuse me, is Mike Steuben here?
- Not till noon, can I help you? - Yeah, yeah.
I returned a car last Saturday and I guess I forgot something.
Hanson?
That's right, Hanson. Yeah, and I'm pretty sure it was a CD.
Hang on.
Here we go, Mr. Hanson.
- Great. - I just need to see some ID.
Yeah, you know, I...
I lost my license.
You have a credit card, the one you used to rent the car with?
Yeah.
- Yeah, this one. - All right.
Okay, great.
- Thank you. - Take care.
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
- Hello? - ANDY: It's me.
Andy, Jesus! Fuck, man, we got problems.
(HEART MONlTOR BEEPlNG)
ON MACHlNE: Hi, Andy. This is Jake at the office.
Really sorry to bother you, but the auditors are coming tomorrow.
They've noticed a few problems.
It's pretty urgent, so give a call when you get this.
You're going to have to get some sleep tonight.
Have you given any thought to the store?
I mean, you're going to have to give it some consideration. It's just gonna...
I could open it up for you, you know, while you're at the hospital.
A few hours a day.
So people know you're still there.
I should burn the goddamn place down.
Andy, this is Jake.
Now I hope you're checking your messages because we have a real mess here.
JAKE: The auditors say that there's two terminated employees from your department still drawing checks.
And there's something about unpaid O ASDI taxes.
Look, you need to call us...
I got to go to the office tomorrow.
There's a problem. I'll go in the morning. I should be back later.
Okay?
His mother's dying, and he's going back to work.
Yes!
Pick up the phone.
I know you're there, pick up the phone, you fucking faggot.
Andy, I'm here.
What are you doing here? You don't have an appointment.
- You know the deal, you can't just show up. - I know, I'm sorry.
Come back in an hour, tonic water.
My mom's dying.
Bummer.
Next time, make an appointment.
Stupid piece of shit.
Stop talking to me like that.
What the fuck?
Are you going to get tough?
Are you going to hurt me?
Why was there even a gun?
Why was there even a fucking gun?
I gave you all the information you needed. Why was Bobby Lasorda even there?
- Why the fuck? - I didn't think I could do it alone.
I should fucking kill you.
How are we going to fix it so your shit don't fall on my shoes?
So, think now, who else knows?
"Commit her body to the earth.
"For we are dust and to dust we shall return.
"But the Lord Jesus will change our mortal bodies to be like his in glory.
"So let us commend our sister to the Lord."
She hated it when I barbecued.
CHARLES: I'm sorry I wasn't able to be what you wanted me to be.
I've never been very good at talking about feelings or showing you that kind of affection or support.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to be the father you wanted.
But I guess I wanted you to be better than me.
And I thought that if I push...
It may not mean anything to you, but I want you to know that I really do love you.
And I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm just so sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be the son you wanted.
You did the best you could.
Still, yeah.
Manage to seem to still like Hank.
He was a lot more of a fuck-up than I was.
- He was the baby. - Yeah.
- He needed us more. - Yeah, he needed you more.
You sure it wasn't his cute looks or his puppiness?
You were the first.
The first always has it rougher.
Yeah, so I'm told.
You know, the four of you, I never felt like I was part of the club.
Beautiful birds of a feather.
You sure I'm your son?
Gina and I have got to get back to the city.
Andy?
My dad.
Andy.
(SOBBlNG)
Okay.
Why don't we pull over?
My dad.
Oh, God.
It's not fair! It's not fair!
All my life I've been afraid of becoming like him. All my life!
All my life with you, and it's not fair.
He can't just say he's sorry and make it all go away.
It's too late.
It's not that easy!
It's not fair! It's not fucking fair!
No, Dad.
Oh, God!
He can't do that!
Andy.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Andy.
- I'll be back in a bit. - Where are you going?
I'll be back soon, I just got to... I got to deal with some stuff.
What's going on?
What if you come home and I'm not here?
You got some place you got to be?
(DOOR SLAMMlNG)
Your boss called and he wants you to call him right away.
Are you in trouble?
They just miss me.
Where are you going?
Something has to change.
- What do you mean? - I mean that this just isn't working.
- What's not working? - The life that we have.
It was really bad before Rio and now it's even worse.
You never tell me anything that's going on anymore.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
What was that in the car yesterday?
I could help.
I don't need any help.
Do you realize that I've been having an affair?
What's that supposed to mean?
Means I've been fucking another guy.
Every Thursday, me and your brother, Hank. We get together and we fuck.
Not only that, he loves me.
And he still finds me attractive.
All the time.
Not just on vacation.
Hank?
Yeah, Hank.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Are you gonna get angry?
(EXCLAlMS IN ANNOYANCE)
- Where are you gonna go? - I was just gonna go to my mother's.
How're you gonna get there?

Last person I ever thought I'd see again as long as I lived.
Charlie Hanson.
You're still a crook?
You come all this way to insult me?
Did you hear anything about a holdup at the Westchester Shopping Mall?
What would I know about Westchester?
That's just for upstanding citizens such as yourself.
Have you heard anything?
Why would I hear anything about anything? I sell diamonds.
- And fence them. - Never!
Did you hear of a young guy called Bobby Lasorda?
Wrong tree, Charlie.
A couple of punks shot my wife in a holdup. She's dead.
I'm sorry.
I don't give a shit about your little side business,
I don't care about anything anymore, except finding the guy who did this.
Do you know anything?
I remember when Charlie Hanson started out on the streets.
Young and cocky, good cutter. A long time ago, Charlie.
You always hated my guts, you called me a crook, but you didn't know shit about how the world works, or what some people will do for money.
I guess, now you know, Charlie.
The world is an evil place, Charlie.
Some of us make money off of that, and others get destroyed.
He walked in here, he looks a little bit like you, Charlie.
He walked in here and I almost knew him, right off the bat.
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
HANK: Hello.
It's me.
Andy, Jesus, man, we got problems.
What do you mean, problems?
Bobby's girlfriend's got a fucking brother, okay.
And the guy is blackmailing me, all right.
He said he's gonna go to the cops, all right, or kill me if I don't pay him $10,000.
All right, all right.
Just stay there, I'll be right over, I'll figure something out.
- Andy, this guy isn't fucking around. - All right, I'll figure something out.
Andy, Jake needs to see you.
They're all in the conference room with the IRS guys.
They're going all the way back
- through your accounts. - Just fuck 'em, I got to go to my dad's.
I'm gonna have to tell them you were here.
For God's sake, say something.
Okay.
We're in trouble.
The worst trouble imaginable. You're aware of that, right?
So, why don't we try and fix it?
There's almost no choice, but you're gonna have to follow my lead.
No questions, no hesitations.
I've done that before, all right, and that's how come I'm standing here, with my life going down the fucking toilet.
Fuck you, fuck you, I'll do it alone.
You can sit here and wait till you go to jail and take it up the ass for the rest of your fucking life.
Let's do it already, what's your idea?
Sorry, what's your idea?
What's Bobby's girlfriend's name?
Chris. Yeah, Chris.
Chris.
Call Chris, tell her to get her brother over to her apartment.
- What for? - We'll meet him.
He figures we owe him $10,000, we have to resolve it.
Resolve it how?
Play it by ear, see what happens, maybe we pay him.
He's never gonna let us off the hook.
All right, we're gonna be paying him back for the rest of our lives.
Hey, you finally figured out something for yourself.
Let's just get the money, see what happens.
Where are we gonna get $10,000?
No, that might be easier.
Call Chris.
ANDY: Taxi!
(GROANlNG)
Andy, Jesus Christ! You're gonna kill him.
Come on.
Shit.

I got it, I got it.
- Oh, shit, do you want these? - Just put it in the bag!
Put it in the bag!
- Out. - Got it.
(GUN FlRES)
Oh, my God, Andy.
- Did you touch anything? - Did you go crazy?
- Did you touch anything? - Are you fucking nuts?
- Did you touch anything? - Wait, you didn't have to kill him, all right.
He's not gonna go to the cops. All right? He's a drug dealer.
Yeah, I guess he'll just go to some other dealers and suppliers and that's all we need, is 10 South Americans chasing us for the rest of our lives.
Did you touch anything?
I don't think so.
- You don't think so? - I don't think so, no!
- No, I didn't touch anything! - Think, God damn it, you think!
- I don't... I don't like this, Andy! - Did you touch anything?
- I don't like...
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Did you touch anything? - No.
Are we good?
Let's go.
You got the money, chico?
I don't like wasted trips.
You don't look happy.
Mind if I call you groucho?

- ANDY: Like what you're seeing? - Yeah, a lot.
- Stand up. Stand up! - All right, all right.
- Turn around. - All right, all right, all right.
So how we gonna do this?
Gladly pay you the money, got plenty of it.
How do we know you're not gonna bleed us for the next couple of months?
I just want enough to take care of Chris.
That's nice, my brother wouldn't take care of me like that.
Hey, what do you say, Chris, should I trust this guy?
- Yes. - Speak up. What?
Yes.
I don't think so.
(BABY WAlLING)
HANK: No, Andy, don't, don't, don't...
- What did you say? - No, you can't do that, I won't let you.
- You won't let me?
- No, no more, you kill her, you're gonna have to kill me.
Not such a bad idea.
You know, in fact, it's a pretty good one.
You know I know.
What do you know?
I know.
I'm sorry.
I fucked it all up.
Just do it.

Let The Right One In
Squeal like a pig. Come on, squeal!
Squeal! Squeal!
The police have ways of detecting a criminal...
Do you remember the fire in Ängby?
A burnt house and they found a body inside.
We know that the fire was started... ... to hide that this person was murdered before.
So, how did we know this? - I know.
- Yes, you. Go ahead.
There wasn't smoke in the body's lungs.
Correct. Have you heard this before?
No... I just read a lot.
What kind of books would those be?
Just books.
Ok, now I'm going to talk to you about drugs.
The kind of drugs you might think are most common-- Hey, Oskar!
What are you looking at?
Are you looking at me? Eat shit!
Oink!
What a good little pig you are.
- Let's go. It's time for gym. - I'm not going.
This is the weather report...
Excuse me... - ...
Can you tell me what time it is? - I don't have a watch.
- What is that? - This? It's called Halotano.
Get out!
Stupid dog!
What are you looking at?
Are you looking at me?
Eat shit!
What is your problem?
Are you scared?
Squeal, then!
Squeal!
- What are you doing? - Nothing.
- What are you doing? - Nothing.
- Do you live here? - Yes...
I live right here in the playground.
Seriously, where do you live?
- Next door to you. - How do you know where I live? Just so you know I can't be your friend.
- What are you trying to say? - Does there have to be a reason?
That's just how it is. How do you know I want to be your friend?
You're supposed to help me!
Should I just take care of myself?
Say something!
Pardon me.
They don't know who murdered the boy.
I imagine that many of you are worried.
The counseler will be here all day long... ...so you can see him if you like.
Any questions?
Is it ok if we kill the murderer if we see him?
That is not ok, Conny.
Oskar...
- Where are you, piggy? - Piggy!
Now you go directly to the school.
And don't leave the yard until I get home.
- But I'm going to Vallingby.
- A man that kills children... ...could easily take the metro for two stations.
Or walk a mile.
No, Oskar, you'll stay with your father next week.
PUNCTURE MURDER FOR BLOOD
THE VlCTlM'S BLOOD WAS EXTRACTED
- Hi. - If not for my sweetheart...
The death penalty isn't right in a just state.
A just state?
The government wants to sell us that crap, like the Russians did...
Are you saying that there aren't any more Russians?
- Of course there are...
- I've never seen one.
But like snakes they haven't bit anyone.
That guy over there just moved next door. He's got a daughter.
Where Janne lived.
- Should I invite him to the table? - Sure...
So long as he buys us a round.
In that case he's welcome although he's got cancer.
Bad news?
Yeah, life stinks...
You're in Department 15, right?
You don't have to stay here alone, come and have a little fun.
No thanks, I'm in a hurry.
Mom, I'm going out for a bit.
You aren't going to watch the show?
No, I don't like it.
Don't leave the yard.
I'll watch it alone then.
Here you are again.
You've returned.
- I want to be alone. Me too.
Go home, then.
You go home, I lived here first.
- What's that? - This?
A Rubik's cube.
Like a puzzle? Yeah...
You wanna try it?
- You can give it back to me tomorrow. I don't know if I'll come tomorrow.
The next day, then, but no later.
How do you do it?
Each side should be only one color.
Like this...
You smell weird.
- Aren't you cold? - No.
- Why not? - I forget.
Thanks for another night of friendship and happiness.
- See you tomorrow. - You're the best, Jocke.
Help...
Hello?
Please help me.
Did something bad happen?
Are you alright?
- Can you get up? - No...
I'll carry you to a phone.
- Careful. - You're so light.
Never again...
Gosta? My god what a long time. I think I haven't seen you all year.
Jocke... Jocke!
I was on the balcony and saw... ...I saw Jocke and that girl.
How old is the girl?
He was here.
Clean it.
What the fuck is that?
Holy shit! It's blood!
Who the fuck did this?
How did you do it?
I just turned it.
Do I smell better now?
What's your name?
Eli.
- And you? - Eli?
I'm Oskar.
- How old are you?
- 12... more or less.
What about you?
12 years, 8 months, and 9 days. What do you mean "more or less"? When's your birthday?
I don't know.
You don't celebrate your birthday?
Your parents should know.
Then you've never even gotten a birthday present?
No.
You can keep it if you want.
It's yours.
I don't know how to solve it.
You want me to show you?
- Sure, here. - Start with the corners.
Then this part. And you put it... ...like this.
No... like this, then this.
"...Dodging in and out of the shadows, running rapidly and silently... ...and hiding from the sun..." ...They returned quickly, between moans and curses, to care for the portal..." ...Bilbo had escaped."

They can go then.
- Oskar, you aren't-- - No, I've got stuff to do.

What were you writing?
What do you mean?
Show it to me.
No.
What are you talking about?
Who's gonna tell your mommy now?
Wait for me!

I slipped in the park... - ...and I fell on a rock.
You have to look where you're going.
Short, long, long, short, long...
- Short, long, long, short, long. - Exactly. Here...
What happened?
There.
Some classmates...
- What school do you go to. - Oskar, listen...
Answer me.
You never answer... ...
Why not?
So do it.
- There's three of them. - Louder.
Hit them as hard as you can, and they'll leave you alone.
- And what if they-- - Then I'll help you.
I can help you.
Come on.
Move.
You're in the way.
Let's go.
Now let's see... short, short...
Maintain your distance.
Not too close nor too far. Keep your distance.
With rhythm and without errors.
Yeah?
For the weightlifting program after school... ...
Can I sign up?
You don't have to sign up, just come at 7 o'clock.
Are you thinking about doing it? Sure.
If you practice, you'll get strong.
See ya later.
Just a second...
Assorted candies.
Take em.
No.
What a pain in the ass.
I'll try one.
I'm sorry.
Oskar...
Do you like me?
Yeah, a lot.
If I wasn't a girl... ...
Would you like me the same?
I think so.
Why do you ask?
Oskar!
Hello, son.
- You're home early. - Hi, Dad. There are people who've seen my face... ...and know that I live here with you.
Maybe you shouldn't.
What else can I do for you?
Can you do something for me?
Can you not see that boy tonight?
What--?
Why are you so late, Matte?
Hey, Matte.
You can touch at home.
Hurry up, Matte.
What are you doing?
- Matte! - Put me down.
Help!
Help!
- Matte! - Help!
- Open the goddam door! - Help!
- Put me down! - What are you doing here?
Eli.
...according to leader of the Communist Party, Congressman Brezhnev.
An unidentified man was arrested yesterday for murder... ...tentatively in Väilingby on the outskirts of Estocolmo.
The man abused himself resulting in serious wounds on his face... ...that made it impossible to identify him.
Now, sports--
You can come in. Through that door.
Yeah?
Excuse me. I'm looking for my father.
Is he in this hospital?
What's his name?
He's sick. The police brought him in.
Do you know where he is?
He's on the seventh floor.
But it's a restricted area. You can call him...
No... that's ok.
Poor creature.
Can I come in?
A child...
What child?
- Why did he kill Jocke? - I ... I don't know.
Jocke was the best subject I have found.
I should tear that girl apart limb from limb.
Oskar!
Can I come in?
Don't look at me.
But you have to let me in.
Ok, come in.
Close your eyes.
How did you get there?
- Flying. - Yeah, right.
You're not even there.
You're as cold as ice.
I'm sorry...
Do I disgust you?
No.
Eli...
Do you want to go out with me? What do you mean?
Well...
Will you be my girlfriend?
Oskar... ...I'm not a girl.
But...
You want to go out with me, right?
Why can't we just leave things as they are? I guess...
Do you do anything special when you go out with someone?
No.
So it's the same. Yeah.
We'll go out together then.
Just you and I.
Seriously? Yup.
Attention!
The lower grades will skate with me.
The older kids can skate alone.
Watch out for her holes.
- Do you understand? - Ávila...
- I think you meant THE holes. - THE holes.
I meant to say THE holes!
You want to be a "diver"? Watch out for HER holes!
Do you want to swim or not?
No.
Mr. Ávila, I have to piss.
- Go behind that tree. - On the ice?
Does it matter? You'll just make more ice, but yellow.
What's that stick for?
To hit you if you try anything.
So you're a brave little piggy all of the sudden?
I'm going to push you and you won't do anything.
Isn't that right?
Little baby piggy watch where you walk or I'll catch you...
Look!
Let's go.
Mr. Ávila will be mad...
Should we stay here and not do anything?
What happened there?
What are you doing?
Of course they accuse us!
What do you want him to say? That my son doesn't have a father? Yeah!
That's it!
Here he comes.
The school called.
Better if you talk to your father rather than me--
Hi.
I'm good.
I don't know.
Does the bike work?
Hi Oskar.
So you finally went swimming?
I'm just kidding.
We shouldn't be here.
But some of the bigger kids come here anyway.
And you know what? Today...
They tried to push me on the ice... but I... ...but I had a stick and I hit Conny so hard they sent him to the hospital.
Oskar...
Yeah?
Well done.
What do you want us to do?
Mix...
It doesn't hurt.
The only thing you have to do is pinch the finger.
Eli?
Get out!
Get out of here!
They had to use a crane to get him out. You have to contact the police.
- What's the problem, Gösta? - They're going to interrogate me.
What are you talking about?
They took me to one of those rooms... ...and they pointed a lamp at my face.
- Jocke and I were like that together. - I'm sorry, but I can't...
It's your responsibility, you were a witness to a crime.
Oh god...
You're thinking what a good guy you were...
Now that it happened, there's nothing left for me.
Nothing.
- Oh, Lacke. - Stop it!
Don't try that "Oh Lacke Lacke" crap.
You don't understand, you were so cold.
No one understands.
Very subtle, Lacke.
Ginia, please wait.
Can we at least talk about it?
Let's go...
Let her go!
Wait... you brought my lighter.
That wasn't my intention, Ginia...
I love you.
What the fuck?
No...
- I didn't wait for that. - You'll never do it.
- But this time I beat you. - Keep dreaming.
You first.
- Look who's here! - Good evening everyone.
It seems like she's getting along very well.
That's true.
Oskar's here...
Ok...
Dad...
-... it's your turn. - We have visitors.
It's warm and cozy here, right?
So did you have fun?
Everything turned out wrong.
It seemed ok, but your calculations were incorrect.
It was a mistake from the beginning.
And it gets worse. When you pass those buildings...
Busy night.
Come on in.
Ginia? Where the hell were you?
What happened? I was so worried about you.
- What happened to you?
No...
Open the door you son of a bitch!
Let me in!
Oskar, is that you?
You're a vampire?
I live on blood... if that's what you mean.
You're... ...dead?
No.
Can't you tell?
But...
You're old?
I'm 12.
But I've been 12 for a very long time.
You're poor?
You see that egg over there?
If you sold it you could buy a nuclear power plant.
Seriously.
Yeah, right...
Put your finger on it.
Where did those rings come from?
I'm going home.
I have to distribute a few thrills tomorrow.
For money?
I can give you money.
Here.
You took this... ...from the people you killed, isn't that right?
- They gave it to me. - Who gave it to you?
Different people.
I'm going home now.
Yeah, you're leaving me.
The time has come to sell this. Dad's stamp collection.
This one, one stamp...
...is worth $80,000.
If we find a good buyer we won't get less than that...
Then we'll buy this pretty cabin.
The country is so beautiful.
We can both live there.
Listening to the birdsong and growing vegetables...
Lacke, you have to help me.
Sure...
That girl...
May have infected me somehow.
I don't want to keep on living.
Good morning!
Everything went well. I think I'll go home today.
Wouldn't he like to?
We'll take this...
And we'll take a blood sample. There we go.
Listen...
Can I open the blinds?
Sure... no problem.
Give me your hat. Let's go!
What's your problem? Give it to me.
Are you stupid? Come on, give it to me.
Give it to him hard, Conny!
- Fight.
- Are you blind as well as deaf?
- Hi.
- What's up?
Can you give me the keys? I'm going home.
- Sure, here you go. - Thanks, see ya.
- Who sent you home? - Good, good...
- What are you laughing at? - Are you hard of hearing, Conny?
- Hi.
You have to invite me in.
And if I don't?
What happens if you just come in?
Is there something in your way?
No!
Come in!
Who are you?
I'm just like you.
What do you mean?
What are you looking at? Huh?
Are you looking at me?
Scream then!
Squeal!
Those are the first words that I heard you say.
I don't kill people.
But you'd like it if you could...
For revenge, right?
Yeah.
I do it because I have to.
I know, Eli, just for a while.
Please, Oskar, I know Eli.
I can give you one of my mom's dresses.
Oskar... ...let me in.
What are you doing?
I'm in the tub, I'm be right there.
Let me in, Oskar.
Hi, I'm in the tub. Please don't come in. You want to go out tonight?
I'd like that very much. Come in, Eli.
I can't see...
No!
Let me go!
Thanks.
Oskar... I should go far away.
WHO KlLLED THE MAN IN THE ICE?
Hello? Is that you, Oskar?
It's me, Martin. Mr. Avila wants to know if you're coming tonight.
Why?
Just wants to know, I guess.
I'm sure he wants you to come.
I'm not sure...
That was good... What you did to Conny.
- He earned it. - What an actor...
You think so?
Sure. Are you coming tonight?
- Ok, Oskar.
Hi, Oskar.
Hi.
Come on, let's do aerobics in the water.
Hurry up!
Come on, Oskar! Let's go!
Move it.
What?
Call the firemen!
Stop!
Do you know who I am?
- Yes.
- Ok, then you should understand.
Let's have a little contest.
You have to stay under the water... ...for three minutes.
If you can do it I'll only cut you a little.
But if you can't... ...I'll take an eye.
An eye for an ear, does that sound fair?
But it's impossible.
That's your problem.
Three minutes.
You'd better breathe deep. five, four, three... ...two, one.
- Jimmy...
- Shut up!
- Come on, Conny. - I said shut up!
Moanin' Low, my sweet man I love him so though he's mean as can be
He's the kind of man needs a kind of woman like me a woman like me... a woman like me... a woman like me... a woman like me... a woman like me... a woman like me... a woman like me... a woman like me... a woman like me...
Rick wants to hire me! He's at a new studio.
Where is it?
When?
I don't rememberwhat year... there's no year...
How do you know there's a yearforthat?
I think they say the 14th Century. The 14th Century was recently.
No, but... I don't know...
That's when... the Moghuls were ruling, Babarwas in India
CK, the 11th then.
It's defnitely B.C.
It's B.C. Forsure and I think it's Ayodhya, where Ram was born
I know thatbecause they razed that temple. They say that Ram was born there.
Which I don'tbelieve - - but that's what they say.
And Ayodhya is in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
Therefore the story has to be true.
It's probably based on as real as event as what the Bible is based on.
You want to know the whole story?
Ch, because Ram's fatherhad 4 wives. 3 wives.
3 wives?
4sons.
4 sons, 3 wives.
CK. I know the names of the sons by the way.
Kausalya...
No, that's the wife, that's what I meant.
Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi.
And Kausalya's son was Ram Sumitra's son was Laxman
Kaikeyi's son was Bharat
I'm so impressed! Yes, and
Shatrughan I think was Laxman's brotherwhich means he had to be, uh
Sumitra's son.
Sita was Ram's wife
Right, and Sita I know also, Sita's fatherwas Janaka. Sita has many names, Sita only being one of them.
Yeah.
Janaki!
Janaki!
Janaki also.
And Vahish, Vahish, uh... I saw a play - Vaidehi.
- Huh?
Vaidehi, I saw a play called Vaidehi, right, which I learned is anothername for Sita.
Ram was about to be crowned by Dasharatha as the king and Kaikeyi went to him and
Because she had done something really good
I think she had taken care ofhim when he was sick. Yes.
And so at thatpointhe had said to her,
"You have one Boon. Anything you ask of me I will do. "
And so she went and asked him to send Ram away for 14 years thinking that was a long enough time, thatif you go away for 14 years, you'repretty muchoutofsight, outofmind.
Rama my son, today I wish to crown you King of Ayodhya but my evil scheming wife Kaikeyi-
Grrr...
- justreminded me of an ancient vow I made.
To honor this vow, instead of crowning you king, I must banish you to the forest for 14 years!
Goodbye, dearboy. You are noble and good.
The embodiment ofrighteousness.
Abrave warrior prince.
Joy of Heaven and Earth.
The Ideal Man.
May the Gods be with you.
Don't let the doorhit yourass on the way out.
That's what she asked for and Dasharatha was heartbroken but given that all Indian men are true to theirword...
He had to... do that. And then he died.
Didn't he die? - No, I...
He died eventually...
No, but all those Ram Leelas I'd seen when I was a kid...
He died right away?
There's this big scene, very dramatic he's having a heart attack when his son is going away.
I do think he was unwell... Yeah that's true.
And he also has a huge issue, right
He's like ravaged by guilt, because Ram is such a good son.
And Ram, when he was told to go away, actually said he would.
He didn't create any problems, he didn't say, "why?"
He just said,
"If thatis yourwish Father, I shall go. "
And then he went.
And Sitasaid,"Ifyougo, Igo. "
No, Sita.
The forestis besetby Rakshasa demons.
They harrass our Wise Men and desecrate theirritual fres.
I must f ght them... alone.
But Rama, a woman's place is next to her Husband!
I will accept any hardship.
Icannotlive withoutyou.
Icannotlivewithoutyou... Icannotlivewithoutyou...
I hate to think what mighthave been if we had never met
Why should I suppose that this could be?
The weary days, the lonely nights, are easy to forget since I am here, and you are here with me.
Here we are, you and I
let the World hurry by
Even while I waited, somehow, dear, I knew
You'dfindme, I'dfindyou
Here we are, alone together what matterwhether, we wander far?
And though we haven't got a bankful, we can still be thankful thathere, thathere we are!
Here we are, you and I
Let the World just hurry by
Even while I waited, somehow, dear, I knew you'dfind me, andl'dfindyou
Here we are, alone together what matterwhetherwe wandered far?
And though we haven't got a bankful, we can still be thankful thathere we are!
That's all!
I'll miss you.
It's only a 6-month contract. I'll be back before you know it!
Ravana was the evil king of Lanka and he just stole Sita.
He was an incredibly learned man.
Actually the only bad thing he seems to have done... ...is capture Sita.
Which is kind ofinteresting because everything else abouthim seems to be, like he was this really learned guy, he knows all these weapons he prays to the right Gods... so all this stuff!
He's like this Good King.
Except that, over time, we've been led to believe he's this complete... thathe's like Mogambo.
That's right, he lived on an island also!
He was a devoted Shiva-bhakta.
And he plays - - all these instruments...
Veena with his intestines.
With his intestines?
Yeah, for Shiva.
There's this whole thing abouthow devoted a fan he was and he's asking Lord Shiva forsome wish and, you know, he is basically playing Veena with his intestines.
It's hard to fell someone like thatin battle, because whatis pain to a man who plays Veena on his intestines?
Nothing much.
What I'm really impressed with is he was the king of Sri Lanka.
No, he was the king of Lanka. It was Lanka.
It's called Ceylon. It's the same country I think.
Well the pointis that's what we think. They built the bridge.
The bridge still exists, so NASAimages says.
Really? NASA?
It must be true then!
Maybe they saw them on the moon!
Isn't there a Suruphanaka story? Suruphanaka right?
Surphanaka. I'm messing up her name.
God, they're gonna be after me
Surphanaka is the one with the really ugly nose. Surphanaka.
But she was Ravana's sister. Ravana!
Rama has slaughtered your Rakshasas in the forest. You must take revenge!
Don't do it, Master. Rama is powerful.
Sister, do notbother me with yourpetty concerns.
Dear Brother Ravana, have you seen Rama's wife Sita?
She is the mostbeautiful woman in the world.
Her skin is fairlike the lotus blossom.
Her eyes are like lotus pools.
Herhands are like, um, lotuses.
Herbreasts like big, round, frm, juicy...
Lotuses!
Mmmm, ahhhh...
Make Sita yourwife, Ravana. Steal her from Rama!
Don't do it, Master!
I'll hearno arguments from you, Mareecha. You musthelp me at once.
Transform yourselfinto a beautful golden deerto distract Rama.
While Sita is unguarded, I'll grab her!
Sita WlLLbe mine!
Hahahahahaaa!
What a beautiful golden deer!
Ch Rama, won't you capture it for me? I don't know, Sita.
It could be a trick!
Ch Rama, pleeeaaase?
All right, Sita. You ask for so little and give me so much.
Butpromise you won'tleave the hut while I'm gone. The forestis dangerous. I promise!
Ch Rama, I love you!
Iloveyou, Sita.
Love was blind to me, now it's kind to me,
Love has opened my eyes.
Since it came to me, life's a game to me with the sweetest surprise.
I neverknew how good it was to be a slave to one who means the world to me.
I loved that man from the start, and way down deep in his heart
I know he loves me, Heaven knows why and when he tells me he can'tlive without me what wouldn't I do forthat man?
He's not an angel orsaint, and what's the odds thathe ain't with all his faults I know he'll getby
I'll be so true to him, he'll never doubt me
What wouldn't I do forthat man?
Ch, when he lets me lean my weary head on his shoulder
I close my eyes right there and wish I never grow older
I'll neverleave him alone, I'll make his troubles my own
I love that man as nobody can
I'm justno good when his arms are about me
What wouldn't I do forthat man?
Ch, what wouldn't I do forthat man?
I'll neverleave him alone, I'll make his troubles my own
I love that man better than I do my self
I'm justno good when his arms are about me
What wouldn't I do forthat man?
Ch there's not a thing I wouldn't do for my man.
That's all!
But you know what Sita does then? How she is able to tell these people where she -
She drops her jewelry along the way.
And that's how they were able to fnd her. It went all the way to Lanka.
How many times did she drop the jewelry?
She was wearing a whole lot of jewelry in the forest.
I mean, no, remember, she's not wearing any jewelry 'cause she left everything before she leftAyodhya and she came -
Ch, she left everything?
Right, she just came in her Sanyasi clothes.
Don't challenge these stories.
She's gone.
I told hernot to leave the hut!
Ch how will I everfnd her?
Sita!
Sitaaaaaa!
Ch Sita, whathas become of you?
Actually, the origins of Hanuman...
All these demons were attacking the Earth and supposedly all the Gods and everyone went to Vishnu and said
"Please help us, please help us!"
So Vishnu said he would be born on Earth as Ram.
Buthe was born as Krishna also, this is very confusing. That's dasavatar, 10 incarnations.
So... the 10th one is the last one, not come yet supposedly.
So anyway, he said what we'll do is,
Shiva will be born as someone who helps him. So Shiva is actually...
Hanuman is an incarnation of Shiva. Ch I didn'tknow that.
- I didn't know that either. Yup.
And, so Hanuman is actually born with the sole purpose of eventually meeting up with Ram and helping him.
Like that was the reason forhis birth.
I will help you. Who are you?
I am Hanuman, the Monkey Warrior!
I am Rama, Prince of Ayodhya. Letus be allies.
I shall be yourservant forever.
Now go, fnd Sita!
Hello? It's me.
Dave!
Where are you?
Trivandrum, silly. Athome. You have a home phone?
Ofcourse.
You've been gone a month and you neveremailed me your phone number.
I didn't? Well, I have some good news.
They've extended my contract anotheryear! What?
Anotheryear? You said you'd be back in 6 months!
But I like ithere.
What about me? What about Lexi?
What about ourapartment? Uhhhh...
What about US?
Don't cry, Nina.
I love you.
You could come here...
She sits under a tree.
And she weeps.
And thinks of Ram. And prays to Ram.
And all these evil people, you know all these movies and all these shows we've seen all these evil people come and sort of scare her, and she prays to Ram.
But the thing is that the women, whatever, the women-demons, who are supposed to protect her, are amazed by herdevotion to Ram.
And so Ravana also comes and says,
"what can Ram do foryou, blah blah blah, that I can't?"
But she's still, "Ram will come here and you still have one last chance
"because once he comes here, you know,
"yourass is grass. "
I love you Sita. You mustbe my wife. Never.
I love only Rama.
I am the chaste and virtuous wife of another man.
I belong to Rama as the rays belong to the Sun.
Give me back to Rama, or you shall soon hear his mighty bow thatresounds like Indra's thunderbolt!
The more a man speaks sweetly to a woman, the more she insults him!
You have two months to decide, lovely lady.
Then you shall share my bed!
If you do not marry me, my Rakshasas will slaughteryou for my breakfast.
Yourugly yellow eyes should fall out of yourhead as you stare at me so lustfully, Ravana.
The only reason I do notreduce you to ashes with my own blazing power is because Rama has not ordered me to do so.
Grrrrowl!
When nightis creepin', and I should be sleepin' in bed if you were peepin', you'd fnd that I'm weepin' instead
My lovin' Daddy lefthis baby again, said he'd come back buthe forgot to say when
Night afternight I'm cryin' Daddy won't you please come home?
Daddy won't you please come home, I'm so lonesome
No one can fil that vacant chair
Home isn'thome when you're not there
No need to knock, the door is open foryou
Please, Daddy
Even the clock keeps tickin' Daddy won't you please come home?
Daddy do you have to roam so very long?
There's lots of othernew sheiks who would like to be sheikin' haven't slipped yetbut I'm liable to weaken
Daddy, Daddy won't you please come home?
Please, Daddy
Even the clock keeps tickin' Daddy won't you please come home?
Daddy do you have to roam so very long?
There's lots of othernew sheiks who would like to be sheikin' haven't slipped yetbut I'm liable to weaken
Daddy, Daddy won't you please come home?
That's all!
She also made her own share of mistakes, in fact she should've just gone back with Hanuman.
The whole idea of"my man has to come to save me," it's like oh, you're one little tight thing.
Jump on the monkey's back, go back, chill out, hundreds will be fne. CK?
Butis itpossible she didn't trust the monkey altogether?
Itis possible. No.
I think she absolutely trusted the monkey but she wanted her man to come.
CK that's another thing, it's like, "You gotta prove it to me baby!"
Butnot only that, she also wanted -
Sorry, go ahead - but she also wanted the evil king to be defeated, like my husband should come and -
CK, why don't you go back, so the evil king doesn'thave a hostage, and then do it?
Butit's almostlike she was trying to glorify Ram through this whole process.
You know, like, "my man will come and he is capable of this
"and he's virtuous, and he will kill Ravan, and... "
She's a bloodthirsty woman.
But my question is, were they monkeys? Because they actually -
They could fy- not monkeys, um, from what I understand they're different from monkeys, they're...
Like from what I understand monkeys are one kind of... one species and then, the Vanars were anotherspecies.
They were half man, half monkey. CK.
Because they had tails though.
Correct. But they're not... Like, yeah.
I defnitely think the tail and the...
They were half... they were defnitely half monkey, ifnot more Yeah but that's what the army was.
Because otherwise they were these two brothers, they didn'thave any army
These two brothers and then all of Sugriv's big army, all the...
The Vanar Sena.
- The Vanar Sena, right. Hanuman!
Assemble the Monkey Warriors.
We shall cross the sea to Lanka and rescue Sita.
Yes, my Lord. We march at once!
Who's thatknockin'? Don't stand outside there, come on in here!
I justhad a sort of feeling this morning something good was gonna happen today
Now there comes a sound without any warning
I justknow it's good luck coming my way!
Goodness gracious, can itbe? Someone's coming back to me
Who's thatknocking at my door?
I've been waiting oh so long, I'll just die if I'm wrong
Who's thatknocking at my door?
I know it can'tbe the mailman, the coal man, the ice man, they've been here today can'tbe the grocer, the butcher, the baker, they don'tknock that way
If my sweetie's there outside, my arms and my heart are open wide
Who's thatknocking at my door?
Me oh my, my oh me, guess I'm having company
Who's thatknocking at my door?
See the time? Eight C'Clock.
Sounds like a familiarknock
Who's thatknocking at my door?
I know it can'tbe the milk man, the gas man, the bread man, who always collects
I hope thatitisn't thatbutterand egg man, who writes out those checks?
Lfit's my sweetused-to-be, gonna lock him in, lose the key
Who's thatknocking at my door?
Can'tbe the plumber, the peddlerthe parlor, cause I've paid those bills
I hope thatit isn't the doctor, the dentist, they can't cure my ills
Ifit's someone that I've known, gonna make him feel athome
Who's thatknocking at my door? That's all!
Dave!
Mmm, Dave!
We're in India. Uh, no... kissing in public.
Let me take yourbag.
Well, here you are.
Goodnlght.
Ch gosh. Later I know whathe did. What did he do when he saw herin Lanka?
Hug herand kiss her... No I don't think so...
No I don't think so.
He was very cold.
Why was he cold to Sita?
Actually I don'tremember. To be honest I'm very shaky on this point...
You can make itup...
You have lived in another man's house so you are unft to be my wife.
What?
I have done my duty in rescuing you from the enemy and avenging the insult to myself.
I have terrible suspicions about yourcharacterand conduct.
Ravana was aware of your beauty.
He cannothave kept you in his house for so long without touching you.
The very sight of you is painful.
You are free to go whereveryou want.
I have no more use foryou, Sita.
If I had known this, I would have killed myselfbefore and spared you this war.
Build me a funeral pyre. I cannotbearto live.
Despite my virtues, my husband has rejected me.
He's obviously doubting her, um, pureness.
I fnd the whole pureness thing really... odd.
I fnd itreally weird thatno one is commending Ravana for not forcibly...
I mean I know we shouldn't commend somebody forthat, but...
Whatifhe raped her?
Yeah butin terms of villians, right? Yeah...
I mean, we expect villains to be villain-ous.
This is a guy that's like, "if you don't come to me willingly, I will not touch you. " Right...
"I will not force you in my house. "
"I will not force myself on you... "
Well he neverhad sex with her, did he? No.
As Sita proved overand overagain.
By trial of fre.
You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Please honey, it seems to me you love to see me crying.
I don'tknow why
I stay home each night when you say you'll phone you don't, and I'm left alone singin' the blues and sighin'.
You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me whenever somebody is near, dear
It mustbe great fun to be mean to me, you shouldn't
Ch can't you see what you mean to me?
Sweetheart I love you, think the world of you, but I'm afraid you don't care for me
You nevershow it, don'tlet me know it, everyone says I'm a fool to be pining the whole day through.
Why do you actlike you do?
You're mean to me, why must you be mean to me
Aw gee, honey, it seems to me, you love to see me cryin'
Please tell me why
I stay athome each night when you say you'll phone
You don't, and I'm left alone just singin' the blues and sighin'
You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me wheneversomebody is near, dear
It mustbe great fun foryou, can't you see what you're doing to me
Please tell me why you're so mean to me!
That's all!
And he's still not convinced, seemed like, aftershe went through the trial by fre
I mean it's almostlike-
No but I thoughthe was convinced. He then, it was peer pressure, laterwith the washerman- yeah, because the washerman-
He was convinced, it wasn't like he doubted her
He kind oflike was "CK, you are pure. "
And I think he did hug herand then f owers fell from the heavens orsomething
Whoops. I guess you were pure after all.
Will you forgive me, Sita?
Cf course, Rama. I live only foryou.
Hey, they want me to attend this meeting so much they're gonna fy me all the way to New York.
5 days, all expenses paid!
That's great. It'll be fun foryou.
See you next week.
No no no, it's a fying chariot, the Gods sent the chariot. I don't know, it's something about-
- a Japanese train! -
I'm fnding it, I found it to be totally cool. It was like the world's frst airplane or something.
It was like the frst-like they actually f ew back.
I think it was on a bird.
Was it on a bird?
I think it was actually a fying thing of some kind.
They rode a carpet like Aladdin.
No, it was like an elaborate structure.
Pushpakha!
That's what they came back on. The fying chariot.
That was one of the Air India jumbo jets also.
And there's a movie, a silent movie
But that's what I mean, it was this thing.
It wasn't a bird - - Pushpakha Vemanum. - Yeah. - right.
I guess whatis happening was the 14 years were fnishing and they had to fnd a quick way to get back.
What does it matterifrain comes your way and raindrops patter along?
The rain descending should not make you blue
The happy ending is waiting foryou
Take yourshare of trouble, face it and don't complain
If you want the rainbow, you musthave the rain.
Happiness comes double aftera little pain
If you want the rainbow, you musthave the rain.
Whatif yourlove affair should break up, as they sometimes will
When you kiss and make up, boy what a thrill!
Sadness ends in gladness, showers are not in vain
If you want the rainbow, you musthave the rain.
Look forbrighterweather, oh watch forthe Sun again
If you want the rainbow then you musthave the rain.
Pull yourself together, whistle a happy strain
If you want the rainbow then you musthave the rain.
So if yourlucky stardeserts you, and if shadows fall
Even though it hurts you, laugh through it all
Be a cheerful loser, you have the World to gain
If you want the rainbow, why, you just must have the rain.
That's all!
Rama, I'm pregnant!
That's wonderful, darling.
Maybe they joined the Mile High Club.
Cn the Pushpakh Veman.
We don'tknow exactly when she gotpregnant-
Very soon thereafter, which is why itis conceivable that she wasn'tpregnantbecause of Ram.
But I think it was Ram.
Blasphemy. Itis Ram.
I'm notlike Rama, who would take a woman who's sleptin another man's house!
No but thathappens with the dhobi. - There's a dhobi story.
You know the dhobi, the launderer- yeah, the dhobi's says that-
The dhobi's wife, she's with somebody else and when she comes back he goes, "What do you think I'm like Ram, to take somebody back now aftershe's -
You know what a dhobi is right? He's a washerman - - and when news of thathits Ram -
Ram says, "I cannotrule, I cannotrule if my subjects don't respect me and so you'll have to -
Actually that's when he banishes her, sorry.
Uh, say, Sita, would you like to take a trip?
But we just gothere.
Yeah great. Getpacking.
Brother Laxman, my wife's dubious reputation casts doubtupon my own.
You must drive Sita to the forest and abandon herthere.
I cannothave herin my kingdom.
I think basically as a king, he had to sort of do...
If the common man was doing that to theirwives then why should the king treathis wife any differently kind of a thing.
Like I felt thathe let hergo notbecause she was impure, butbecause he said that to be a king, he needs the respect of his subjects, and he can'tbe considered -
I don't think he lether go because -
I felt thathe alwsys had this element of doubt
I mean it coupled with, of course, his virtue that everybody spoke of and you know that he kepthis word to his Dad, and then his subjects, his Kingdom, but I feltlike he always had this doubt, that she mightnotbe pure.
But I feltlike he always had this doubt, that she mightnotbe pure.
I feel too bad, I'm feelin' mighty sick and sore
So bad I feel, I said I'm feelin' sick and sore and so afraid my man don'tlove me no more.
Day in, day out, I'm worryin' about those blues
Day out, day in, I'm worryin' aboutbad news
I'm so afraid, my man I'm gonna lose.
Moanin' low, my sweet man I love him so, though he's mean as can be
He's the kind of man needs a kind of woman like me
Gonna die if sweet man should pass me by, if I die where'll he be?
He's the kind of man needs a kind of woman like me.
Don'tknow any reason why he treats me so poorly, what've I gone and done?
Makes my troubles double with his worries when surely, I ain't deservin' ofnone
Moanin' low, my sweet man is gonna go, when he goes oh Lordy
He's the kind of man needs a kind of woman like me.
Don'tknow any reason why he treats me so poorly, what've I gone and done?
Makes my troubles double with his worries when surely I ain't deservin' ofnone
Moanin' low, my sweet man is gonna go, when he goes, Lordy!
He's a man that needs a woman justlike me.
I musthave committed a terrible sin in a previous life to deserve such suffering.
Were I not carrying Rama's sons, I would throw myselfinto the river.
She's always shown to be pregnant- - afterwards
No, when she's banished and she's gone into the forest again.
And there she meets that teacher.
- Valmiki.
- Valmiki. Sorry.
So that's how Valmiki wrote the Ramayana, because Sita told the story to him.
I'm just a woman, a lonely woman, waitin' on a weary shore
I'm just a woman, that's only human, one you should feel sorry for.
Gotup this morning, along about dawn
Without a warning, I found he was gone.
Why should he do it? How could he do it? He neverdone it before.
Am I blue, Am I blue
Ain't these tears in these eyes tellin' you
Am I blue, You'd be too
If each plan with your man done fell through.
Was a time, I was his only one
Butnow I'm the sad and lonely one, Lordy.
Was I gay, til today
Now he's gone, and we're through, am I blue!
As blue as the sky blue
You're wondering what do these tears in these eyes tellin' you?
No one feels like I do
Boo hoo,
Boo hoo, Boo hoo,
Boo hoo, Boo hoo, Boo, hoo...
Each plan with my man done fell through.
Was a time, I was his only, only, only one
Butnow I'm the sad and lonely one, Lordy!
Was I gay -oh Lord was I gay!
Til today - that man went away!
Now he's gone, and we're through, am I blue!
Anyway, so Luv and Kush, or Luva and Kusha, were born to Sita in the forest and were taughtby Valmiki, who taught them all these songs praising Ram.
Luv, Kush, letus sing the praises of Rama.
Rama's great, Rama's good, Rama does what Rama should
Rama's just, Rama's right, Rama is ourguiding light
Perfect man, perfect son, Rama's loved by everyone
Always right, neverwrong, we praise Rama in this song
Rama's great, Rama's good, Rama does what Rama should
Rama's just, Rama's right, Rama is ourguiding light
Perfect man, perfect son, Rama's loved by everyone
Always right, neverwrong, we praise Rama in this song
Hello?
Please take me back! Please please please!
I'll do anything! PLEASE!
If you had a girlfriend who was being treated really badly, by like herex orhercurrentboyfriend and she kept saying, "no, every day I'm gonna make sure I cook for him and send him a hotlunch atnoon"
Aren't you going to be like, "listen, he doesn'tlike you or talk to you.
"You've got to move on. Something's wrong. " CK?
Sita's doing this pooja every day... I mean, I feel, I feel...
Like this whole "good" and "bad" thing? That we always want people to be either all good or all bad?
I think Sita also has herown issues.
Like she didn't go back with Hanuman she would have saved hundreds and thousands ofpeople from being killed
Monkeys especially.
Yeah, what about animal rights?
And, and then she prayed forthis guy every day, come on!
But also at thatpoint of time it was just that Unconditional Love
You know, for her, she was like, ok,
"this man, he loves me. "
- This is the part of the female perspective I disagree with.
Because it's like then you can say, "oh yeah, 'cause she loves him so she did this" you know it's like, yeah but she shouldn'tlove someone who doesn't treat herright.
- Who treats you so badly.
CK? That's her mistake.
That's HENCE unconditional love.
You went away, I let you
We broke the ties thatbind
I wanted to forget you, and leave the pastbehind.
Still the magic of the night I met you seems to stay foreverin my mind...
The sky was blue, and high above the moon was new, and so was love
This eagerheart of mine was singing,
"Lover where can you be?"
You came atlast, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing, "Lovercome back to me," when
I rememberevery little thing you used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along, I walked along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the nightis cold the moon is new, butlove is old and while I'm waiting here, this heart of mine is singing,
"Lovercome back to me. "
Sky is blue, night is cold, moon is new, butlove is old and while I'm waiting here this heart of mine is singing
Lovercome back to me!
That's all!
And when Ram was in the foresthe heard these two boys singing, he didn'tknow who they were buthe came up and he was just like,
"who are they, who are you?"
And that's when he fnds out that
Sita's there and those are his children.
My sons!
Father?
Return to Ayodhya Palace to rule with me foreternity!
But then, he wants to take Luv and Kush back, buthe's still hesitant about taking herback.
Sita! Well, yes, ofcourse, Sita...
All Sita has to do is prove her purity. Again.
Anothertrial by fre, perhaps?
Crwe could try trial by water. You know, see if she sinks or f oats.
If she sinks, she's pure. If she f oats -
No, wait, if she f oats she's pure, if she sinks...
And he asks herto prove herpurity one more time - I think, actually I don'tknow ifhe asks herorwhatever-but she says,
I shall prove my purity to you.
If I have always been true to Rama, if I have never thought of another man, if I am completely pure in body and soul, then, may Mother Earth take me back into herwomb!
I'm fying high, but I've got a feeling I'm falling falling fornobody else but you

Hey, you reached Doug. Sorry, I missed your call.
Please leave a name and number and I'll get back to you.
Hi, you've reached Dr. Stuart Price with Prime Dentistry.
Please leave a message after the...
Hey, this is Phil. Leave me a message, or don't.
Do me a favor. Don't text me, it's gay.
Anything?/ I tried them all. It keeps going straight to voice mail.
There has to be an explanation./ Sweety, it's Vegas.
You'll lose track of time in those casinos. There's no windows, or clocks.
He's probably on a heater.
And you never walk away from the table when you're on a heater.
You do if you're getting married.
Tracy, it's Phil.
Phil, where the hell are you guys? I'm freaking out.
Yea, listen...
We fucked up.
What are you talking about?
The bachelor party, the whole night.
Things got out of control and, uh...
We lost Doug.
What?/ We can't find Doug.
What are you saying, Phil? We're getting married in 5 hours.
Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.
Subtitle by:
D34N [subscene.com]
You have to move... Thank you.
Whoa, watch it pervert!
It's okay Alan. He's just doing your inseam.
It's getting very close to my shaft.
All done. You can change now.
Thanks, Floyd. Thank you very much.
Alright, buddy. We should get a move on.
You know, Doug. I was thinking...
If you wanna go to Vegas without me, it's totally cool.
What are you talking about?
Phil and Stu, they're your buddies and it's your bachelor party.
Come on, Alan. Those two love you.
I also don't want you to have to hold back because your wife's brother is there.
It's not like that...
It's not like that. I already told you, Alan.
We're just spending a night in Vegas. It's no big deal.
Besides, you're not just my wife's brother, you're my brother now.
I want you to know, Doug, I'm a steel-trap.
Whatever happens tonight, I will never, ever, speak a word of it.
Okay, I got it. Thank you. I don't think that...
Seriously, I don't care what happens. I don't care if we kill someone.
What?
You heard me. It's Sin City.
Hold your soul.
Okay, I got it.
Thank you./ No. Thank you.
I love you so much.
No, Sid.
Really?/ Come on. We're family now.
Are you sure? You love this car.
Doug, it's just a car. Just make sure when you get there...
Put some armor all on the tires so the sand doesn't seep in.
Absolutely. That's easy.
Don't let Alan drives. Because, there's something wrong with him.
Understood./ And Phil either. I don't like him.
I will be the only one driving this car. I promise./ Good.
Remember. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
Except for Herpes. That shit'll come back with you.
Hold on, I still need some of your permission slips.
And $90 for the field trip to the Griffith observatory next weekend.
Pay now or forever regret missing out in this experience of a lifetime, guys.
You're good. You got it./ Thank you Mr. Wenneck.
Thank you, Wilson. Thanks Bob. Way to go.
Do you have to park so close?/ Yeah. What's wrong?
We shouldn't be here.
Why is that Alan?/ I'm not supposed to be within 200 feet of a school.
What?/ Or Chuck E. Cheese.
Hey, Mr. Wenneck./ It's the weekend, Nick. I don't know you. You do not exist.
Shit. Nice car./ Yeah./ I'm driving.
No chance, but... Don't step...
Will you shut up and drive before one of these nerds ask me another question.
Who's this?/ It's Alan. Tracy's brother.
I met you like, four times./ Oh yeah. How you doin', man?
Don't forget your Rogaine./ Rogaine, check.
And don't forget to use it.
I can totally tell when you forget. Your hair just looks thinner.
Using of the Rogaine, check.
And make sure to call me right when you get to the hotel, not like that...
Conference in Phoenix. I had to wait two hours for you to call me.
I was the keynote speaker. I was late to the podium.
Still.../ Yeah, you're totally right. I'm sorry.
What is the matter?/ I don't know.
I just know you're gonna go to a strip club when you're out there.
Melissa, we're going to Napa Valley.
I don't even think they have strip club in wine country.
I'm sure if there's one, Phil will sniff it out.
It's not gonna be like that.
Besides, you know how I feel about that sort of thing.
I know, it's just, boys and their bachelor parties. It's gross.
You're right. It is gross.
Not to mention it's pathetic. Those places are filthy.
And the worst part is...
That little girl grinding, and dry humping the fucking stage up there.
That's somebody's daughter up there./ That's somebody's daughter up there.
I was just gonna say that./ See?
I just wish your friends were as mature as you.
They are mature, actually. You just have to get to know them better.
Paging Doctor Faggot.
Doctor Faggot.
I should go./ That's a good idea, Dr. Faggot.
Have a good weekend. I'll miss you.
Road trip!
Hey, Vegas! Vegas, baby.
Vegas.
Come on, just 'till Barstow. Everybody's passing us.
Absolutely not. I promised Sid, I will be the only one driving this car.
Besides you're drinking./ What, are you a cop now?
You know I drive great when I'm drunk.
That's true. Don't forget Phil was always our designated drunk driver.
Do you wanna explain to them, Alan?
Guys, my dad loves this car more than he loves me, so yeah.
I left my wife and my kid at home so I can go with you guys to Vegas.
Do you know how difficult that was?
It's really sweet, Phil.
I was being sarcastic. I fucking hate my life.
I may never go back. I might just stay in Vegas.
Here we go.
You know, Doug. You should enjoy yourself, because come saturday...
You're gonna start dying a little bit. Everyday.
That's why I managed to stay single this whole time.
Oh, really? That's why you're single?/ Yeah./ Cool. Good to know.
Am I alright over there, Alan?
Yeah, you're good./ Alright.
Oh, Jesus Christ!/ Oh, my God.
That was awesome.
That was not awesome! What's wrong with you.
That was insane. We almost just die.
You should've seen your face. It's classic.
It's not funny.
You've got a sweet ride there./ Don't touch it.
Don't even look at it. Go on. Get out.
You heard me. Don't look at me either.
Yeah, you better walk on.
He's actually kind of funny./ Yeah, he means well.
I'll hit an old man in public.
Is he all there, like, mentally?
I think so, he's just not guy, and he's kind of weird.
Should we be worried?/ No.
Tracy did mention that we shouldn't let him gamble or drink to much.
Jesus, he's like a gremlin. Comes with instructions and shit
And one water.
I'll go with Melissa?/ Oh, yeah.
I told her we're two hour outside of wine country, and she bought it.
Don't you think it's strange that you've been in relationship for 3 years..
But you still have to lie about going to Vegas./ Yeah, I do.
But, trust me it's not worth the fight.
So, you can't go to Vegas but she can fuck a bellhop on a carnival cruise line.
Okay, first of all, he was a bartender. And she was wasted.
And if you must know, he didn't even come inside her.
And you believe that?/ Yeah I do believe that.
Because she's grossed out by semen.
That'll be $32.50.
It's $32.50, I'll pay for it.
It says here we should work in teams. Who wants to be my spotter?
I don't think you should be doing too much gambling tonight, Alan.
Gambling? Who said anything about gambling?
It's not gambling when you know you're gonna win.
Counting card is a foolproof system.
It's also illegal./ It's not illegal. It's frowned upon, like...
Masturbating on an airplane.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal too.
Yeah, maybe after 9/11 where everybody gets so sensitive.
Thanks a lot, Bin Laden.
Either way, you gotta be super smart to count cards, buddy./ Oh, really?
It's not easy./ Maybe we should tell that to rain man...
Because he practically bankrupted the casino and he was a 'ratard.'
What?
He was a 'ratard.'
Retard.
Here we go.
Hi, welcome to Caesar's./ Hi.
Checking in?/ Yeah.
We have a reservation under Dr. Price./ Okay, let me look that up for you.
Dr. Price? Stu, you're a dentist. And don't try and get fancy.
It's not fancy if it's true./ He's a dentist. Don't get too excited.
And if someone has a heart attack, you should still call 911.
We'll be sure to do that.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you know if the hotel is pager-friendly?/ What do you mean?
I'm not getting a sig' on my beeper./ I'm not sure.
Is there a payphone bank? Bunch of payphones? Business.
There's a phone in your room./ That'll work.
I have you in a two bedroom suite on the 12th floor, is that okay?
Sounds perfect./ Actually, I was wondering if you have any villas available.
Phil, we're not even gonna be in the room./ That's unnecessary.
It's no big deal. We can share beds. One night.
If we share beds, I'm buckle with Phil.
You good with that?/ No, I'm not good with that.
We're not sharing beds. What, are we 12 years olds?
Lisa, I appologize. How much is the villa?
We have one villa available, and it's $4200 for the night.
Is it awesome?/ It's pretty awesome.
We'll take it.
Give her your credit card./ I can't give her my credit card.
We'll split it./ Are you crazy? No, this is on us.
You don't get it. Melissa checks my statements.
We just need a credit card on file.
We won't charge you anything until you check out.
So you can figure it out then./ Perfect. That's Perfect. Thank you, Lisa.
And we'll deal with it tomorrow. Come on.
Fine.
Can I ask you another question?/ Sure.
You probably get this a lot. This isn't the real Caesar's Palace, is it?
What do you mean?
Did Caesar live here?/ No.
I didn't think so.
Holy shit.
This is Vegas.
Oh, my... This place is enormous.
Now we're talking.
It's all one suite?
Thank you, guys. Or should I say thank you, Stu.
You're welcome. It's only because I love you.
Okay, ladies, pick a room. Get dressed. We should be ready in 30 minutes.
I just wish you could see this place, because you, of all people...
Would love it. Yeah. No, it's so quiet.
There's no TVs, no phones.
They just have this cute little antique radios in all the rooms.
What else?
We met the proprietor. What's his name?
Ceasar Palace. Yeah, like the salad.
Okay, I gotta go. Because we're gonna hit this wine tasting.
Okay, wait. I love you.
Bye.
I'm not even gonna say anything. It's so embarassing.
Where's Alan?/ He went downstairs.
He said he had to grab a few things.
Good. Because I have something to show you.
What the hell is that?/ What do you think it is?
That's what I think it is. I think it's a big fucking mistake.
I'm gonna proposed to Melissa at your wedding. After the ceremony.
Stuey, congratulations./ Thank you, Doug.
That's a beautiful ring./ Yeah, that's my grandmother's.
She made it all the way through the holocaust with that thing. It's legit.
I don't get it. Have you not listen to anything I've ever said?
Phil, we've been dating for 3 years. It's time. This is how it works.
A, that is bullshit. And B, she is a complete bitch.
Hey, that's his fiance.
It's true. You know it's true. She beats him.
That was twice and I was out of line. She's strong-willed. And I respect that.
Wow. He's in denial.
Not to mention she fucked the sailor.
He wasn't a sailor. He was a bartender on a cruise ship. You know that.
Guys, I'm standing right here, so I can hear everything you're saying.
Hey, guys, you ready to let the dogs out?/ What?
Let the dogs out. You know, like, who let the dogs out.
Who brought this guy along?
Yes, Alan. We're ready to let the dogs out. Hey, congrats./ Thank you.
You're not really wearing that, are you?/ Wearing what?/ The man purse.
You're actually gonna wear that or you guys just fuckin' with me?
This is where I keep all my things. I get a lot of compliments on this.
Plus it's not a man purse. It's called a satchel. Indiana Jones wears one.
So does Joy Behar.
We're going up, guys./ Yeah, that's perfect.
Really?
We're going up?
I'm just saying it's clearly marked, okay?
We're definitely not supposed to be up here.
C'mon, Stu. We're paying for the villa. We can do whatever the fuck we want.
Just wedge the door up.
Guy's come on up here.
How the hell did you find this place?/ Don't worry about it.
You alright?/ Yeah.
Look at the view up here./ Are you happy?/ This is great.
Wow. Are you kidding?
Alan, how are we doing, buddy?/ Good.
What do you got over there, Alan?
That's the Eiffel Tower.
A little Yagermeister. Good idea./ Good call./ On the roof.
This is good. I'd like to make a toast.
To Doug and Tracy.
May tonight be...
But a minor speed-bump and in otherwise very long and healthy marriage.
Cheers.
It's like college./ I wanna talk about something.
I'd like to... I'd like to say something.
That I prepared tonight./ Alright, Alan.
Hello.
How bout that ride in. I guess that's why they call it Sin City.
Ha-ha-ha.
You guys might not know this, but I considered myself a bit of a loner.
I tend to think of myself as a one-man wolf pack.
But when my sister brought Doug home, I knew he was one of my own.
And my wolf pack, it grew by one.
So there were two of us in the wolf pack.
I was alone first in the pack, and then Doug joined in later.
And six months ago, when Doug introduced me to you guys...
I thought, "Wait a second. Could it be...?"
And now I know for sure. I just added two more guys to my wolf pack.
Alright.
Four of us wolves. Running around the desert together. In Las Vegas.
Looking for strippers and cocaine.
So tonight, I make a toast.
What do you got there?
What the fuck?/ What are you doing?
What is that?/ Blood brothers.
God damn it. Alan, no./ I'm not doing that. Make him stop.
Alan, we're not gonna cut ourselves. Give me the knife. Slowly.
Are you alright? Do you need a doctor?
He's fine. He's good.
Are you sure?/ I'm good./ Perfect.
Alan, come here, buddy./ Get in here, crazy.
Alright. To a night the four of us will never forget.
Cheers.
What the fuck?
Control yourself, man. God damn. Will you put on some pants?
Phil, do not go in the bathroom./ Alan, just calm down it's me.
Phil, there is a tiger in the bathroom.
What's going on?
There's a jungle cat in the bathroom.
Okay, I'll check it out.
Becareful. Don't.
Holy fuck. He's not kidding. There's a tiger in there.
No, there isn't./ Yeah.
That bitch is gigantic.
You okay, buddy?/ No. I'm in so much pain right now.
God damn. Look at this place.
I know. Phil, they have my credit card downstairs. I'm so screwed.
How does a tiger get in the bathroom? It almost killed me.
You mind putting on some pants? I find it a little weird I have to ask twice.
Pants, at times like this? I dont have any.
What the fuck happened last night.
Hey, Phil, am I missing a tooth?
Oh, my god.
My lateral incisor, it's gone.
Okay, just calm down. We're fine. Everything is fine.
Alan, go wake up Doug.
Let's get some coffee and get the fuck out of Nevada...
Before house-keeping shows up.
What am I gonna tell Melissa? I lost a tooth. I have no idea how it happened.
You freaking me out, man. I got a massive headache. Let's just calm down.
How am I supposed to calm down? Look around you.
Hey, guys, he's not in there.
Did you check all the rooms?/ Yeah, I looked everywhere.
Plus his mattress is gone.
He probably went to the pool to get something to eat. Let's call his cell.
I look like a nerdy hillbilly.
Alan./ Hey.
It's Phil./ Oh, hey phil...
This is Doug's phone.
No shit./ Yeah.
What the fuck is that?
Whose fuckin' baby is that?
Alan, are you sure you didn't see anyone else in the suite?
Yeah, I checked all the rooms. No one's here.
Check its collar or something.
It's okay, baby.
Stu, we don't have time for this.
Let's go hook up with Doug. We'll deal with the baby later.
Phil, we're not gonna leave a baby in the room.
There's a fucking tiger in the bathroom.
It's not our baby./ Yeah, I gotta side with Stu on this one.
Alright, fine. We'll take it with us. Can you at least find some pants?
Why can't we remember a god damned thing from last night?
Because we obviously had a great fucking time.
Why don't you just stop worrying for one minute.
Proud of yourself.
Oh, how cute. What's his name?
Ben.
Carlos.
Carlos?
Hey, Phil, look.
He's jacking his little weenis.
Pull yourself together, man.
Not at the table, Carlos.
I looked everywhere.
Gym, casino, front desk nobody seen Doug. He's not here.
He's fine. He's a grown man.
Seriously, Stu. You gotta calm down. Here, have some juice.
Okay, let's just track this thing.
What's the last thing we remember doing last night?
The first thing was we're on the roof and we're having shots of Yager.
And then we had dinner at The Palm, right?/ That's right.
Then we play crabs at the Hard Rock, and I think Doug was there.
That sounds right. No, he definitely was.
You know what, guys? I don't even remember going to dinner.
I know. What the fuck? I don't think I've ever been this hungover.
After the Hard Rock I blacked out. It was like emptiness.
We have him until 10 p.m so that gives us...
A twelve hour window where we could've lost him.
What is this?
Oh, my god. That is my tooth.
Why do you have that?
What else is in your pocket?
No, it's a good thing. Check your pockets.
Do you have anything?
I have an ATM receipt from The Bellagio.
11:05 for $800. I am so fucked.
I have a valet ticket from Caesar's. Looks like we got in at 5:15 am.
Oh, shit. We drove last night?
Driving drunk. Classic.
What's on your arm?
What the fuck?/ Jesus. Phil, you were in the hospital last night.
I guess so, yeah./ You okay?
Yeah, Alan. I'm fine.
What the hell is going on?/ Stu, this is a good thing. We have a lead now.
Hey, Stu. Watch this.
Do you ever see a baby do that?
Alan, it's not cool.
Are you sure you're qualified to be taking care of that baby?
What are you talkin' about? I've found a baby before.
You've found a baby before?/ Yeah.
Where?/ Coffee Bean.
Hey, Phil, I don't think Doug would want us to take the Mercedes.
Relax we'll be careful.
My dad is crazy about that car and he left Doug in charge.
Alan, we got bigger problems here. Doug could be in hospital. He could be hurt.
Let's worry about the car later.
Guys, check it out.
Is that the mattress from Doug's room?
What the fuck?
Hey, what's going on?
Some assholes threw his bed off the window last night.
No shit.
Some guys just can't handle Vegas.
It's gonna be okay, Stu.
How the hell did a mattress...
Here's your car, officers.
Oh, god.
Alright, everybody act cool. Don't say a word. Let's just get in and go.
Stu, you got a 5?/ No.
I'll hit you on the way back.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, my god.
You just nailed the baby.
My glasses okay?
Your glasses are fine, dick.
This is so illegal.
Can't you see the fun part of anything?
Yeah we're stuck in traffic in a stolen police car...
With what is sure to be a missing child in the back seat.
Which part of this is fun?
I think the cop car part is pretty cool.
Thank you, Alan. It is cool. Doug would love it.
Come on.
Check this out.
Oh, no. Don't, Phil. Don't do this./ Take it easy.
Just don't try to call for more attention to us./ Attention./ Sorry.
Attention, please. Move out of the way.
I repeat. Please disperse.
Phil, stop the car. I wanna get out. Pull over.
Ma'm, in the leopard dress...
You have an amazing rack.
Get off the sidewalk.
I should've been a fuckin' cop.
Look, I already told you.
You came in here with a mild concussion, some bruised ribs.
No big deal.
Although none of you could articulate how it happened.
Do you remember how many of us were here?
I don't know. I think it was just you guys.
Definitely no baby.
And one other guy.
That's our guy. Was he okay?
Yeah, he was fine. Just whacked out of his mind. You all were.
Alright. Come forward.
And turn.
Alright, here we go.
And cough.
Cough.
Give me one more.
Alright. Attaboy.
Felix, you can put your robe on. The nurse will be here in a minute.
I'll see you after the weekend.
Thank you, doctor.
Guys, I really gotta go. I'm sorry. I have a surgery up on the 4th floor.
I know. We just need a couple more minutes of your time.
Yeah. Tuck it right in there. I don't wanna resterilized.
Walk with me.
Okay, here we go. Patient name Phil Wenneck.
2:45 a.m arrival.
Minor concussion like I said. Some bruising. Pretty standard.
Do you mind if I take a look. I'm actually a doctor.
You said that several times last night. But, really, you're just a dentist.
Okay, this is interesting.
Your blood work came in this morning.
They found a large amount of Roophyilin in your system.
Roophyilin? Roofies? Commonly known as the "Date Rape Drug?"
Are you saying I was raped last night?
Actually...
I don't think so. But, someone did slip you the drug.
I'm not surprised you don't remember anything.
Doc, none of us can remember anything from last night. Remember?
How could someone drugged all of us?
I wouldn't be worried about it. By now the stuff is out of your system.
You're gonna be fine. I have to go.
Wait, please doctor.
Is there anything else like something we've been talking about?
Or some place we were going?
Actually there was something.
You guys kept talking about some wedding last night.
Yeah. No shit. Our buddy Doug is getting married tomorrow.
I want the hundred back./ No. Easy.
You kept talking about some wedding that you just came from.
At the Best Little Chapel.
You guys kept saying how sick the wedding was...
And getting all crazy about it.
I hope this helps, fellas. I really have to leave.
You know Best Little Chapel? Do you know where that is?
I do. It's on the corner of 'get a map' and 'fuck off'.
I'm a doctor, not a tour guide.
Figure it out yourself, okay? You're big boys.
What about the baby?
Just leave him in the car. We're only gonna be 5 minutes.
We're not leaving a baby in the car./ He'll be fine. I cracked the window.
What if they don't remember us./ Well, let's just find out.
Excuse me sir.
Look at these guys. What happened? You missed me?
You miss Eddie. You want more from me? Come here, my friend.
Look at this guy. You fuckin' crazy.
What's going on, man?
Listen, I wanna tell you something. I know some sick people in my life.
This guy is the craziest, wildest bastard I ever met in my life.
This guy is out of his mind. What's going on, you fucking crazy motherfucker?
I thought he was gonna eat my dick.
What happened? No love for Eddie? You don't hug me?
No, it's not that, Eddie. It's just that...
We're having a hard time remembering what happened here last night.
Was there a wedding here? Do you do a weddings here?
You're cracking my balls, man.
Eddie, obviously we were here last night. We're looking for a friend, Doug.
Do you remember him?/ Yeah. The small guy. Like a monkey.
You saw him?/ Of course.
Is there anything you can tell us about what may have happened last night?
You don't remember nothing?
Congratulations, Stu. You got married.
This can't be happening.
Oh, god./ Look at that.
I tell you one thing. You looked seriously happy here, man.
That's it. My life is over.
Stu, its okay. Shit happens. Melissa's not gonna know anything about this.
This never happened. I'll take care of it.
Hey, what's all that?
The high-roller package. It's what you guys order.
I have coffee mugs.
You have baseball caps, huh?
And fancy calendars all with pictures of Stu and Jade.
Her name's Jade?/ Yeah, she's beautiful, man.
Clean. Very tight. Tits, like that.
That explains the baby./ Oh, Carlos./ Great.
Alright. Eddie, here's the deal. We made a major mistake last night.
We need to get this marriage annuled immediately.
You do annulments?/ Of course I do annulments.
It breaks my heart and gonna make me very sad.
But it's not a problem. I'm gonna make a very good price for you.
I can't do it with just him though. I need the chick. I need both parties.
Not a problem. That's great.
Isn't that great, Stu?
C'mon, buddy. She probably know where Doug is.
Awesome./ Alright.
We need her address. She must have filled out some paperworks, right?
Of course.
Hey, excuse me. What's the matter with you?
Go get the paperwork now. I've spent my life waiting for you.
Come on. And get the bakhala, please.
Hey, Phil, what about my dad's car?
I'm sure Doug has it. We'll get it back.
Then I vote we torch the cop car and all the shit with it.
Torch it? Who are you?
I don't know, Phil. Apparently I'm a guy who married a complete strangers.
This whole situation is completely fucked.
These mugs. This hat. This car.
That is why we're torching all of it.
I'm a school teacher. I got a family.
I'm on for secrecy. But I'm not gonna torch a fuckin' cop car.
Fine. I'll do it.
Can I help?/ Yeah. Thanks.
Shit. Is it Doug?/ I don't have any./ It's Doug.
It's Melissa.
Don't answer it./ I have to. She's called twice already.
Hey, sweetheart. How are you?
There you are. It's the third time I'm trying you.
I know. The receptions up here is crazy.
I think it's all the sequoia trees block the signal./ I hate that.
So, how was it last night?
It was really fun actually. It's kinda quiet. It was a good time.
That sounds nice./ We're on in all kind of vino factoids.
So cool if I could breast-feed, you know.
We're about to go for a tractor ride. So I should probably get going.
A tractor ride?/ So pretty.
Let's go. Out of the car.
What was that?/ They just started up the tractor.
I think it backfired.
Where the hell is he?
Hey, easy. I think we're looking for the same guy.
What the hell, man?
Where the fuck are you? Is that a baby?
Why it has to be a baby? We're in winery. It's a goat.
Where is he?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sir, could you please start the tractor so we can get out of here?
I'm trying to but we're fuckin' blocked.
Oh, my god. What the hell is happening, Stu?
Hey, there's a baby on board!
Someone just said baby.
Get out of the car./ It's a baby goat.
Chinese guy, why do you making trouble for my business, man.
Go away from here now.
Get out of the fuckin' car./ Phil, he's got a gun./ No shit he's gotta gun.
I gotta call you back.
They shot Eddie./ Fuck this shit.
Go, go, go.
That was some serious shit. Who were those guys?
We're gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
What the fuck is going on?
I have no idea.
Why don't you just let that one go to voice mail?
That's a fake laugh, by the way.
It's got Ted Danson and Magnum P.I. and that jewish actor.
Shut up, Alan. What room was it again?/ It's 825.
I already checked with her.
I've found him. I call you back.
Thank god. He's with his father.
I was freakin' out.
I miss you, sweety.
Honey, I miss you.
What the hell happened to you guys?
Actually, we were hoping you could tell us.
What do you mean? I got up this morning.
I went to get you guys some coffe, and I came back and you were gone.
Why are you being so quiet?
I'm no being quiet.
He's so cute.
I gotta feed Tyler. Come inside, you guys.
Did you hear that? The baby's name is Tyler.
I thought he looked more like a Carlos too, buddy.
Okay, what's up. You guys are acting weird.
Look, it's Jade, right?/ Very funny, Phil.
Right, Jade. Uh.
Do you remember our friend, Doug?
Are you kidding? He was the best man in our wedding.
Exactly. We can't find him and we got a little worried.
Oh, my god. That is so Doug.
I'm gonna go clean him up. It's alright. Daddy didn't mean it.
Oh, my god.
What the fuck, man? You gotta hold it together.
Holy shit./ She is super hot. You should be proud of yourself.
She is wearing my grandmother's ring.
The ring I'm gonna give to Melissa.
Remember my grandmother's holocaust ring?
She's wearing it.
I didn't know they give out rings at the holocaust.
He's okay./ Good.
He was just hungry. That's fine.
About last night. Do you remember the last time you saw Doug?
I haven't seen him since the wedding.
The wedding. Okay.
What time was that at?
I guess it was around 1. Because I had to go back to work and finish my shift.
And then when I got out. I headed over to the hotel with Tyler.
And was Doug there then?
I didn't see Doug. Because you guys were passed out.
The room was a wreck. So I was just curled up next to Stu.
I got a question.
You said when your shift ended. Is that mean you're a nurse?
Or a blackjack dealer?
You know this. I'm a stripper.
Technically I'm an escort, but stripping is a great way to meet the clients.
Smart.
Savvy.
But that's all in the past now that I'm marrying a doctor.
I'm just a dentist.
Police. Freeze!
Shut that baby up.
Okay.
So after we take the mugshot, we bring'em on down here...
Where they wait to be interviewed by the arresting officers.
Trust me, kids. You do not want to be sitting on these benches.
We call this place Loserville.
Follow me.
Hello.
Hey Tracy, it's Phil.
Hey, Phil. Where are you guys?
We are at the spa, at the hotel.
Cool. I just get some sun. Is Doug around?
Of course he's around. Why wouldn't he be around?
I'm just wondering why you're calling me.
We made a deal, no talking to girlfriends or wife.
We just call each other's.
Okay. What's up?
You are not gonna believe this. We got comp an extra night at the hotel.
You did?
Yeah. The suite is ridiculous. It's out of control.
It was room service and a butler.
We had figured to spent the night here and then...
We're just gonna come back totally relax in the morning.
You wanna stay an extra night? But the wedding is tomorrow.
That's why we're gonna get up really early and...
We'll be back with plenty of times.
Okay. Are you sure that's a good idea?
Wenneck, Price, Garner. Room 3.
Okay, Trace, I gotta go. Talk to you later.
Come on. Chop chop./ Just spin around.
Wait a second./ I'll go over.
There we go.
Gentlemen. We got some good news and some bad news.
The good news is, we found your Mercedes.
That's great news.
It's over impound right now.
We picked it up at 5 a.m this morning. Parked in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd.
It's weird./ Yeah. It is weird.
There's also a note.
It says, "couldn't find the meter, but here's 4 bucks."
The bad news is...
We can't get you in front of the judge until Monday morning.
Officer that's just impossible.
We need to be in L.A tomorrow for a wedding.
You stole a police car.
We didn't steal anything. We found it.
If anything, we deserve a reward or something. Like a trophy?
I see assholes like you everyday./ Every fuckin' day.
Let's go to Vegas. We all get drunk and laid.
Let's steal a cop car, 'cause it'll be really fuckin' funny.
Think you can get away with it? Not up in here!
Not up in here!
Sir...
If I may. I'm assuming that squad car belongs to one of you./ Yeah.
I'm not a cop.
I'm no hero.
I'm a school teacher.
But if one of my kids went missing on a field trip...
That looked really bad on me.
What are you getting at?
Yeah, Phil. What are you getting at?
No one wants to look bad.
We gotta get to a wedding.
And you guys don't need people talking about some obnoxious tourist...
Borrowed your squad car last night.
The point is, I think we can work out a deal. Discretely of course, ma'm.
What do you say?
Let me ask you a question.
Do any of you gentlemen have any heart conditon, or anything like that?
No.
Okay, kids. You're in for a real treat today.
These gentlemen have kindly volunteered to demonstrate...
How a stun gun is used to subdue a suspect.
What?
Now, there's two ways to use a stun gun.
Up close and personal.
Or you can shoot it from a distance.
Do I have any volunteers who wanna come up here to do some shooting?
How bout you, young lady. Come on up here.
Let's go, handsome. Come on.
Not you, fat Jesus. Slide it on back.
You, pretty boy.
It's real simple. All you gotta do is point, aim, and shoot.
You don't really wanna do this.
You can do this. Just focus.
Don't listen to this maniac. Let's think this thing through.
Finish him!
Right in the nuts. That was beautiful.
Well done. Give her a hand, everybody. Alright./ Good job.
Good job. Well done. That was great.
Hey, we got one more charge left.
Anybody wanna do some shooting up here?
How about you, big man. Come on up here.
Okay. Same instructions. Just point, aim, and shoot.
There you go. That's the stuff. I like the intensity.
Eye the tiger. Good.
You're holding 50.000 volts, little man. Don't be afraid to ride the lightning.
In the face.
He's still up.
Everybody relax. Take it easy.
We've seen it before. He just need a little extra charge.
There we go.
Somebody's big boys. You gotta give them two shots.
Alright, kids. Who wants to get their fingerprints done?
Come on. Let's go.
Fuck those guys.
Do you hear me?
That was bullshit. I'm telling everybody we stole a cop car.
He let us go. Who cares.
I care. You can't just do that. You can't just tase people.
Because you think it's funny.
That's police brutality.
I'm getting a soda. Do you guys want anything?/ No.
One man doesn't shut up. Jesus Christ.
Alan, you okay?
I'm just worried.
What if something happened to Doug. Something bad.
Come on, you can't think like that.
What if he's dead?
I can't afford to lose anybody close to me again. It hurts too much.
I was so upset when my grandpa died.
I'm sorry. How did he die?
World War Il./ Die in the battle?
No he was skiing in Vermont. It was just during World War Il.
Alan, Doug is fine.
Why hasn't he called?/ I don't know, but we're gonna figure it out.
I'll tell you another thing.
6 to 1 odds are our car is beat to shit.
Stu, not now.
Seriously, how much do you wanna bet? It's like fucked up.
That's enough. Alan is seriously worried. Let's not freak him out anymore.
I'm sorry, Alan.
We'll search the car for clues, and everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, shit. I can't see that.
I'm not looking.
Oh, thank god.
It's gonna be alright.
Anything?
I got a cigar.
I found a black shoes./ A women shoes?/ I don't know.
Whose are those?/ I don't know. It's men size 6.
It's weird.
What is this, a snake skin?
Oh, come on.
That's a used condom, Alan.
Get it out of the car.
I got a jizz on me.
Get it out.
Oh, my god.
What the fuck, man? We gotta get this shit together, guys.
What was that?
It's in the trunk.
Doug's in the trunk.
Holy shit.
Open it./ Okay.
Please stop.
I'm with you.
You gonna fuck on me?
Nobody's gonna fuck on you.
We're on your side. I hate Godzilla. I hate him too.
He destroys cities.
Please.
This isn't your fault. I'll get you some pants.
What the fuck was that?
I have an internal bleeding.
Please call 911.
That's some fucked up shit. Who was that guy? He's so mean.
Guys, there's something I need to tell you.
Last night on the roof, before we went out...
I slipped something in our Yagermeister.
What?
I'm sorry. I fuged up, guys.
You drugged us?
No, I didn't drug you. I was told it was ecstasy.
Who told you it was ecstasy?
The guy I bought it from at the liquor store.
Why would you give us ecstasy?
Because I wanted everybody to have a good time...
And I knew you guys wouldn't take it. It was just one hit each.
I used to do 3 hits at night.
But it wasn't ecstasy, Alan. It was roofies.
You think I knew that, Stu?
The guy I bought it from seemed like he was a real straight shooter.
I'm sorry. You mean the drug dealer at the liquor store wasn't a good guy?
Let's just calm down./ You fuckin' calm down.
He drugged us. I lost a tooth. I married a whore.
How dare you. She's a nice lady.
You're such a fuckin' moron./ Your language is offensive.
Fuck you.
Let's just take a deep breath.
This is a good thing, guys.
At least it's not some strangers drugged us for god knows what reason.
You're right, Phil. It's totally a good thing.
We're so much better off now.
Here's something I would like to remind you two of.
Our best friend, Doug, is probably face down in a ditch right now...
With a meth head, butt-fucking his corpse.
That's highly unlikely./ It's true.
This is not help. Let's get our shit together, guys.
Let's go back to the hotel and I'm gonna make a couple calls...
Maybe Doug's back there. Maybe he's asleep.
Come on. Let's go.
Stu, little help?
Shut up.
Oh, god. Are you okay? Alan, I'm sorry.
Wait, guys.
What about the tiger? What if he got out?
I keep forgetting about the god damned tiger.
How the fuck did he get in there?
I don't know. Because I don't remember.
Stu, keep it down.
It's one of the side-effects of roofies, is memory loss.
You are literally too stupid to insult.
Thank you.
Hey, come on.
Did we leave the music on?
Don't make any sudden movements.
Who the hell are you?/ Who the hell are you?
Quiet.
Mike Tyson?
This is my favorite part coming in right now.
I can feel it coming in the air tonight.
The chorus line, guys.
Oh, Lord.
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life.
One more time, guys.
Oh, Lord.
Why did you do that?
Mr. Tyson would like to know why is his tiger in your bathroom.
Hold on. That was completely unnecessary.
I'm a huge fan. When you knocked out holmes...
Explain.
We were drugged last night. We have no memory of what happened.
It's true. We got into all kinds of trouble last night.
And now we can't find our friend.
And if you wanna kill us, just go ahead, because I don't even care anymore.
Stu, what are you talking about?/ I don't care.
Why the fuck do you want to steal his tiger?
We tend to do dumb shit when we're fucked up.
I don't believe you guys.
Wait, how did you guys find us?
One of you dropped your jacket, found it in the tiger's cage this morning.
That's Doug's.
Yeah, Doug. His wallet and his room keys in there.
That's our missing friend./ I don't give a fuck.
Did you guys see him?
I was vast asleep.
Because if he was up, this shit wouldn't had gone down so smoothly.
Maybe the tiger would ate them up like Omar.
Respect.
What happened to Omar?
Don't worry about Omar. He's not with us no more.
I know this is asking a lot, but do you think there's anyway that we could go...
To your house and look around to see if there's any clues for our friend?
Absolutely. How else do you think we're gonna get the tiger back anyway?
Come on, Champ.
I'm sorry?
We're not gonna put it in the Bentley. You brought it here, you bring it back.
What do you think? About 40 minutes?
Don't make me come back for him.
That was Mike Tyson./ No shit that was Mike Tyson.
I'm just saying, he's still got it.
Are you okay?
Where did he get him?
This does not seem fair.
It's rock, paper, scissors. There's nothing more fair.
Alan should do it.
Alan took a punch from Mike Tyson, come on. For Doug.
Why are you peppering the steak. You don't know if tigers like pepper.
Tigers love pepper. They hate cinnamon.
Phil, just do it. You should do it.
I would, but you lost. It wouldn't be right.
I jammed 5 roofies in there. Just go in there and throw it to him.
Fine.
Make sure he eats the whole thing.
Hey, kitty.
Hey, sweety. It's okay. A little snack for you.
We want you to eat this, okay?
Just have a little...
What do we do now?
We wait.
What do tigers dream off when they take a little tiger snooze.
Do they dream of mauling zebras or Halle Berry in her Catwoman suite.
Don't you worry, you pretty stripped-head we're gonna get you back to Tyson...
And your cozy tiger bed.
And then we're gonna find our best friend Doug...
And then we're gonna give him a best friend hug.
Doug, Doug, oh.. Doug, Dougie-Doug, Doug.
But if he's been murdered by crystal meth tweakers...
Well then we're shit out of luck.
By the end we're all gonna die.
Watch it.
That's his nose.
Hey guys, when's the next Haley's comet?
Who cares, man./ Do you know, Stu?
I don't think it's for another 60 years or something.
It's not tonight, right?/ No. I don't think so.
But you don't know for sure?
No.
I got this cousin, Marcus who saw one he said it blew his mind.
I wanna make sure I'll never ever miss out on Hailie's comet.
So if you guys now there's gonna be one...
Get out.
Oh, my god.
Stu, he got me.
You got clawed./ I'm bleeding.
I can't do it./ Get your fuckin' hand back in there. You're steering the car.
I'm too nervous.
Alan, we need you, buddy. It's your time to shine, okay?
My dad's gonna kill me.
That's it./ That's good.
Keep it straight.
You're late.
Whatever, man. We had to push at the last mile.
Come on in. Mike's got something he wants to show you.
Things got out of control, man. You gotta put it down.
When we got back, we took a look at the security cameras.
Great.
Oh, it's Doug./ Thank god he's alive.
That's our buddy. That's who we've been missing.
We're all best friends.
Why don't you just pay attention. I don't have all night.
Yeah, of course.
That's me. I'm on TV.
I've never been on TV before.
Really? Really, Alan?
You're gonna overflow the pool, man.
Maybe, I... Should I wait outside?
I think that's a good idea.
Don't touch anything out there either.
He's not our good... We don't know him that well.
By the way, man, where did you get that cop car from?
We stole it from this dumbass cops.
Nice.
High five there.
I have to say, I've never seen a more beautiful, elegant, regal creature.
Check it out, Stu. Fuck this tiger.
Oh, my god. It's awful.
Who does shit like that, man?
Someone who has a lot of issues obviously.
I'm a sick man.
That's all we got.
This was, hugely helpful.
Because now we know that our buddy Doug was with us at 3.30 totally alive.
Thanks again, champ.
We're so sorry we stole your tiger.
Don't worry about it. Like you said, we all do dumb shit when we're fucked up.
I did say that.
Everyone says Mike Tyson is a badass, but I think he's kind of a sweetheart.
I think he's mean.
I think it's officially time we call Tracy.
Hallelujah. Finally. Phil says something that make sense.
We don't have much of a choice. And who knows maybe she's heard from Doug.
That's what I've been saying this whole time.
We just need to be completely honest and tell her everything.
We don't need to tell her everything.
We can leave out the stuff about me marrying a hooker.
Just stay focus on Doug.
What am I gonna tell my dad about this car?
Alan, relax. It's just the inside.
I got a guy in L.A who's great with interior.
Oh, Jesus./ Oh, my god.
Are you guys okay?
I know that guy. That's the guy from the trunk.
Get out of the car, please.
Those are the guys that shot Eddie.
I want my purse back, assholes.
Your purse?/ That's not a purse, it's a satchel.
It's a purse, okay?
And you steal from wrong guy.
Wait a second. We stole from you?
We don't remember anything that happened last night.
So help us out a little here.
Apparently, you guys met at the crabs table late last night.
You're on your real heater when you played your hot streak.
You ended up winning just under 80 grand.
No shit.
80 grand. Nice.
That's good.
You put the chips in his purse, and then you guys took off with it.
That doesn't sound like us.
Mine had 80 thousand dollars inside.
And this one? Nothing.
Hey, there's skittles in there.
Don't let the beard fool you. He's a child.
He's funny because he's fat.
This was obviously a very simple misunderstanding.
Alan picked up the wrong purse, it's no big deal.
If it's no big deal, why when I come after you guys...
He starts screaming like crazy, and throw me in trunk.
I did that?
You said he was your lucky charm. And you wanna take him home with you.
Lucky charm./ That's just funny.
Fuck you.
If you want to see your friend again, you get me my 80 grand.
What?/ Our friend?
You have Doug?
Doug.
Chill out, goatie.
Alright. Fine.
What do you want?
Not so good now.
Douchebag.
We're very sorry, but this is an easy fix.
Alan, where's his purse?
I don't know./ You said it was in hotel room, right?
We can get it.
We can get you. We can even write you check right now.
No chances. Cash only.
There's a person in there.
Boring.
Take nap. Come on.
You can't have our friend.
Kindapper!
Run me over.
Bring money to Big Rock in Mojave Desert at dawn.
Tooddle-loo, mothafucka.
At least take the bag off his head.
Get out of here.
Guys, I'm telling you I looked for it this morning before we left.
It's not anywhere.
Stu, how much you got in the bank?
About 10 grand, maybe more. I was gonna use it for the wedding.
You're already married. So we're good there.
Besides not for Melissa. She's the worst.
Doug told me she had sex with a pilot or something like that.
It was a bartender on a cruise. What is wrong with you, people.
Alan, did you just eat sofa pizza?
Yeah.
What are we gonna do. We're so fucked.
Hey, guys...
Do you find it?/ No.
But check this out.
Change only.
Ten thousand
Hey, this seats taken?
No, feel free.
Let's play some blackjack.
That's it.
Shut up, Vincent.
I'll stay.
Fuck you.
Splitting 5.
Too many.
I don't even know you. But I'm gonna tell you, that's dumb.
Hey, c'mon. He can't lose.
I think the pit boss is watching him.
Are you okay?
I'm such a klutz. I get so nervous when I gamble. I'm so silly.
Hold on a bit.
Let's just take it easy. This is my wife.
It's hurting./ Does it hurt?/ Yeah.
You alright?/ I don't know./ I don't know either.
I think you're fine. Let's go./ Really? okay.
Sorry. She's had a little too much drink.
Thanks, buddy. That's for you.
And 100, 200, 300, 400.
With all this, that's $82,400.
God damn it. I don't fucking believe it.
Alan, you're the man./ You are too, Phil.
We should come back next week. Take the whole city down.
I'm free next week.
Or we could just focus on getting Doug back right now.
Next week is no good for me. The Jonas Brothers are in town.
But any week after that, it's totally fine.
I think it's safe to say that our luck has officially turned around, guys.
We are back, baby.
We are fuckin' back.
We are back. Classic.
We are back.
We are getting Doug back.
And we're the three best friends that anybody could have.
We're the three best friends that anyone can have.
And we'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever, leave each other.
We're the best three friend that anybody could have.
I mean the three best friend that anybody can have.
Now what?
Give him the signal.
What signal.
Flash your lights. Let him know it's on.
What's on?
The deal.
Of course it's on. We just drove 30 miles into the desert. He knows it's on.
Phil, just do something.
Fine.
See?
Alright. Let's go.
Funny. The fat guy fall on face.
You okay?
Alright. We got the money.
80 grand. Cash.
Throw it over. Then I give you Doug.
I'm sorry. First of all, good morning. We didn't catch your name last night.
Mr. Chow. Leslie Chow.
Mr. Chow. It is a pleasure. My name's Stu.
We would very much appreciate an opportunity to see Doug...
Before we give you the money just to verify that he's okay. If that's cool.
Of course, Stu. That is cool.
Okay.
See? He fine. Now give me money or I shoot him...
And I shoot all you motherfuckers.
And then we take it. Your choice, bitches.
Give him the money, Stu./ Okay.
It's all there./ Let him go.
Alright, take it easy.
Ta-da.
Is this some kind of a joke? Who the hell is this?
That is not Doug.
What are you talking about, willies? That him.
No. I'm sorry, Mr. Chow. That's not our friend.
The Doug we're looking for is a white.
I told you you had the wrong guy, little boy.
Damn, Alan. What the fuck you got me into?
You know him?
Yeah. This is the guy that sell me the bad drugs. How you doin'?
I ain't sellin' you no fuckin' bad drugs.
Wait. He sold you the roofilin?
Roofilin? I sell no roofilin.
Who gives a shit! Where is Doug?
I am Doug.
Your name's Doug?/ Yes, I'm Doug.
His name's Doug too. Classic mixed up.
Come on.
Hey, Chow! You gave us the wrong Doug.
Not my problem.
Fuck that shit. Now you give us our 80 grand back and take him with you.
No. Come on, man. I'll be your Doug.
Oh, yeah. Okay. I take him back.
Right after you suck on this little Chinese nuts.
Oh, that's nasty.
How that sound?
So long, gay boys.
Wait a second.
He's a nasty little motherfucker.
Did you happen to get any ecstasy?/ No, I have no fuckin' ecstasy.
God, damn it!
Gosh, darn it!
Shit!
Shoot!
Hello.
Tracy, it's Phil.
Phil, where the hell are you guys. I'm freaking out.
Thanks for the lift back to town.
I got a question for you./ What's that?
How did you wind up in Chow's car?
That crazy asshole kidnapped me yesterday.
But why? I mean, why you?
Cuz he thought I was with you guys, cuz we all hangin' over at the Bellagio.
What?
We were at the Bellagio?
Yeah. We were shooting crabs. You don't remember?
No. We don't remember. Because some dick drug dealer...
Sold him roofilin and told him it was ecstasy.
Roofilin. There you go with that word, Roofilin. What the hell is a Roofilin?
Wow. You are the world's shittiest drug dealer.
Roofilin, for your information, is the date rape drug. You sold Alan roofies.
Oh, shit. I must've mixed up the bag. My fault, Alan.
Damn, Marsha's gonna be pissed off with me on that one.
Whatever.
It's funny cuz just the other day, me and my boy...
We was wondering why do you even call'em roofies.
You know what I'm talking about?
No. I don't know what you're talking about.
Why not floories, right? Cuz when you take'em...
You more likely to end up on the floor than the roof.
What about groundies. That's a good new name for'em.
Or how bout rapies?
Wait, what did you just say?
Rapies./ Not you. Doug, what did you say before?
I said groundies.
No. Before that. You said...
You're more likely to wind up on the floor than...
Listen, Trace, I'm really sorry...
Hello?
Tracy, it's Stu.
Stu, talk to me. What's going on?
Nothing. Don't listen to Phil. He's completely out of his mind.
He's probably still drunk from last night.
Where's Doug?
He is paying the bill. We just had a delicious brunch and...
We're in a big hurry to get back so we gotta get going.
Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye.
What the fuck, man?
I know where Doug is.
I don't know, man. It just hit me.
Do you remember when we saw Doug's mattress impaled on that statue?
Yeah, it's because we threw it out the window.
No it's impossible. You can't open window in Vegas hotel.
Then how did it get...
Oh, my god!
Wait, what's goin on?
Doug was trying to signal someone.
Holy shit. How did you figure that out?
Doug made me realize it.
Doug?/ Not our Doug. Black Doug.
Hey, easy with that shit. C'mon./ Sorry.
Can someone tell me where white Doug is?
He's on the roof, Alan.
Yes. He is on the roof. We must have taken him up there on his mattress...
As a prank so he'll wake up on the roof.
It's like that time in summer camp. Remember when we moved...
His sleeping bag out in the jetty in the lake?
Which was hillarious.
It's not so funny now, though cuz we forgot where we put him.
You guys are fuckin' retarded. You know that?
Holy shit. You think he's still up there?
There's only one way to find out.
Doug.
Doug.
Doug, you up here, buddy?
Where you at, Doug?
Hey, guys, he's over here.
Phil, we've found him. He's over here.
He's okay.
You're okay?
Oh, god. We gotta go, buddy. Come on.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
What the fuck is going on?
We can explain everything, but right now we gotta go.
Hey, bud. You okay?
No. Not okay.
You look good. You got some color. I'm jealous.
I'm getting married today.
Yes. Doug, that's why you need to focus and do everything we say.
Because frankly you're wasting a little bit of time right now.
You fucking asshole!
Oh, my skin burns.
It's okay. It's not your fault, Doug.
Don't touch me. Shut up. All of you shut up.
Just get me home.
Just get me home.
What about the one after that?
You cannot be serious.
Oh, god damn it. Every flight to L.A is booked.
What about in the Burbank?/ It's already sold out.
Fuck. We can't drive there. The wedding starts in 3.5 hours.
Alan, where's the car?
It's on its way.
You know what? We can drive there. We can make it.
Just give me one second.
We will leave without you.
Is he missing a tooth?/ Yeah.
Thanks for helping out last night. That was so awesome./ Sure.
Listen, Jade...
You don't have to say it. I totally understand.
This whole thing was stupid.
It was stupid, wasn't it?
This is yours.
Thank you. I can't believe I gave my grandmother's holocaust ring...
To someone I just met. What was I thinking?
You were really fucked up./ Clearly.
You did pull out your own tooth.
I pulled out my tooth?
Why did I pull out my own tooth?
Alan bet you you weren't a good enough dentist to pull out your own tooth.
Okay. Of course he did.
But you won.
Yeah. Clearly.
That's victory, right there.
This should go down.
It's good./ No. Safety first.
Alan, it's fine. It's down.
No. I gotta get it down first.
Don't mess the car up.
You're gonna mess the car up.
What are you doing next weekend?
I don't know. Working. Why?
Cuz I was thinking maybe I'll come back to get us to dinner or something.
Really? Like a date?
Yeah, like a date. Only the one that I, hopefully I remember.
Sounds good.
Stu./ Stu.
C'mon./ C'mon.
I gotta go.
Okay. Bye.
Bye./ Bye.
Alright, let's go.
At least the trip wasn't a total disaster.
What makes you say that?
When I woke up on the roof, I happened to find... $80,000 worth of Bellagio chips in my pocket.
Oh, my god.
Looks like we're going home with some money, boys.
Here he comes. That's him.
Hey, Victor./ What's up, Alan?
Wow, look out!/ Oh, shit.
Thanks, Vic./ Adios.
Who the hell was that guy?/ That's my buddy.
Sorry, It took us on a really crazy route.
How's my hair?/ It's good.
Is it cool like Phil's?
It's classic Phil.
She looks beautiful, man.
Sorry I'm late.
Vegas.
Where were you? And why are you so red?
Honey, it's a long story.
We are gathered here today because of the strength of love and the promises...
All I know is, I am so sorry.
And I promise for as long as we're married...
I'll never, ever put you through anything like this again.
Can you forgive me?
Yeah. Uh-huh. So seductive.
I take you to the candy shop. I let you lick the lollipop.
Go ahead, girl don't you stop.
Keep on going until you hit the spot.
You can have it your way.
How do you want it? Gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Break it down for you now baby it's simple.
You be a nympho, I be a nympho.
I got the magic stick. I'm the love doctor.
Daddy!/ Hey, my man.
Excuse me. But I'm expecting my husband any minute.
It's very funny.
Come here. How was your soccer game?
Go ahead girl don't you stop. Keep on going until you hit the spot.
Fuckin' give it to me baby nice and slow.
Climb on top ride it like you in a rodeo.
Stu? You're avoiding me?
Hey, Melissa.
Oh, my god. What happened to your tooth?
Have you met Alan? Tracy's brother.
Okay.
That is disgusting. Why haven't you returned my calls?
There was a snafu with it when we stopped...
I called that bed and breakfast in Napa...
They said they had no record of you even checking in.
That's because we didn't go to Napa.
Stu, what the fuck is going on?
We went to Las Vegas./ Oh, really? Las Vegas?/ Yup.
Why would you go to Las Vegas?
Because my best friend was getting married and that's what guys do.
Really? But that's now what you do!
Then why did I do it, huh? Cuz I did it. Riddle me that!
Why did I do it?
Sometimes I think all you want me to do is what you want me to do.
I'm sick of doing what you want me to do all the time.
I think in a healthy relationship sometimes a guy...
Should be able to do what he wants to do.
That is now how this works!
Oh, good! Because whatever this is, ain't workin' for me.
Oh, really?/ Yeah.
Since when?
Since you fucked that waiter on your cruise last June.
Boom!
You told me it was a bartender.
Oh, you were right. I stand corrected. It was a bartender.
You fucked a bartender.
You're an idiot.
You're a... You...
You're such a bad person.
Like, all the way through to your core.
Alan, shall we dance?
Let's do this.
Hey! I'm gonna leave forever.
I'm gonna learn how to fly high.
It was a real pleasure meeting you.
Fuck off.
I'm thinking about getting my bartender's license.
Suck my dick.
No, thank you.
Remember, remember, remember, Remember my name, babe!
Dougie, I gotta tell you, man. That was a gorgeous wedding.
I'll give it 6 months.
You're a dick.
I don't know what to say. Thanks, for the bachelor party, I guess?
Yeah. I just wish we could actually remember some of it.
Hey, guys. Look what I found.
Whoa, that's my camera.
Yeah, it was lodged in the back seat of the car.
Are there photos on it?
Yeah. Some of it is even worse than we thought.
No fuckin' way. Give me that.
Wait.
We look at these pictures together, okay? One time.
And then we delete the evidences.
I say we delete it right now.
Are you nuts?
I wanna find out how I wind up in the hospital. Is that in there?
Yeah, it's in there.
Guys, one time.
Deal?/ Deal.
Oh, dear Lord!

Lenore, come on, wake up.
I don't think so, baby.
Come on, I gotta get to work.
You want me to call you a cab?
Are you trying to get rid of me? 'cause I'm not going anywhere till I get some coffee.
- I have a new client for you.
- Ow! - If you play it right,
She just might be the answer to our problem.
- What problem? - Ray, you haven't landed a regular.
This one might be a window to a whole new clientele.
- Window, great. - Don't fuck it up, Ray.
Okay? We need to get you a steady client that you fuck,
But don't fuck up.
I agree. I would love a steady, stable client too.
- Your coffee. - Ugh!
Oh my God, Ray, what the fuck is this shit?
- It's coffee. - Is this instant?
Yeah, it wakes me up in the morning.
It's, you know, strong and cheap.
You're so classy, Ray.
All right, so listen, let's clear the air.
We had some good, hot sex,
But now we're back to our clearly defined whatever.
If we want to be regular, you know, fuck bunnies, that's okay too,
But I think that the important thing
- Is not to make this into something that it isn't. - Great. Yeah.
I agree. Let's not make it a regular thing, you know?
It was just good old-fashioned fun fucking.
Exactly. So who's gonna tell Tanya?
About what?
About this. We can't keep secrets from each other.
It's not good for anyone.
We're not telling Tanya.
Why not? Because she'll feel left out?
That's what happens when two people have sex, Ray.
Unless of course there are multiple partners involved.
Look, Lenore, it's a terrible idea. I don't want to tell Tanya.
Fine, I'll keep my mouth shut.
But I think you're being a little dishonest.
I thought she was your friend.
I gotta call a cab.
Her name's Samara, Ray. Don't fuck it up!
Hey, Tanya, it's Ray.
I just wanted to call
And say hi.
And good morning.
And I'm sorry about yesterday...
Mike and Frances and you had to take the money back.
Let's talk.
God, I wish you could have been there!
I threw down 20 after 20 and I told her
And her uptight fucking colleagues to shove it up their ass.
I mean, screw 'em, Charlie. Am I right? What do they know?
- I don't know those people. - I know them, okay?
I know them. Right, Frank?
- Mm-hmm. - Elitist fucking shits.
Fuck! Oh God, Charlie.
What did I do? I spent everything.
And if Ray finds out, he's gonna kill me.
Hey, what I say is keep on collecting.
Charlie, Mike doesn't even know
That he's a prostitute.
Ho always know it's a ho.
I don't know. I just... I don't think I'm that kind of a person.
And what are you, huh? Are you some kind of new moral pimp?
I'm not moral! I'm just saying that I have feelings.
I'm a pimp who feels.
Look at those shoes she got on.
They're... they're nice, right? Italian.
I slept with her sister and she got mad.
I felt bad she got mad so I bought her them heels.
And now we're friends again.
Charlie, it's just too simplistic.
- It's too simplistic. - Really?
Yes, I can't just buy Ray a gift.
It's doesn't... ugh!
I just... I'm sorry. I'm so wound up.
It's just I can't relax.
It's just... it's hot in here. you wanna play pool?
- Let's play pool - I think you should fuck me.
I...
What?
I'm just saying if you need to relax,
Then you can fuck me because I know how to calm them nerves.
Yes, I do.
So Ronnie kill beaver,
Now you okay to make baby?
That's not why, mother.
How long you think to get pregnant?
A few weeks? A few months?
Where will baby sleep?
Where will baby sleep?!
oh damn it.
Mom, could you I don't go grab my purse? In garage.
I need my makeup. why you lock door?
You lock me out of household, eh?
Hold on!
Old people go to garage, get pneumonia and die!
Would you hold on?
House have four bedrooms:
You, me, Damon, Darby.
When baby comes, where will baby go?
To grandma room.
And grandma go to garage.
You'll get Damon's room
And he'll go to the garage, okay?
Now I'm asking you to please go get my purse and give me some privacy.
Gary sunshine, drew lindo...
Oh man, Tony Barton!
We've got to call Tony Barton. the nose knows.
- How many old timers we got? - Alumni, Ray.
It's an alumni game. We ain't old timers yet.
Oh shit! Who's that, coach?
Who's that handsome young man?
"Ray Drecker, third base."
- You gonna play this year or what? - No, Mike, I'm retired.
Come on! "today's a great day and I feel wonderful."
I like seeing you like this, pal.
- So you and Frances, huh? - Yeah.
How is that going?
- I'm not the type to kiss and tell, Ray. - Okay, sorry.
It's going great, man!
I'm seeing her again tomorrow.
She's got the whole weekend planned too.
Wow, that's... great.
I don't want to fuck this one up.
I haven't felt this good since my wedding day.
We know how that turned out.
Hey, you're not gonna fuck it up, pal.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
- What am I doing? - I don't know.
Whatever it is you do.
- What do you do? - I don't know.
It just is, you know? It's nice
- And simple. - Simple, ah.
- but what do you do?
I don't know.
Whatever she wants.
I hold the door open for her, I pull the chair out for her.
Candy and flowers, Ray.
I'm an old-fashioned guy. me asking Mike for advice about women...
Hey, whatever it takes.
Hungry?
- Allow me. - Thank you, Richard. What can I say?
I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy.
Mmm, I love this kind of food.
Yeah? You like middle eastern food?
Oh yeah. You know, my neighbor
Brings it over all the time. It's good hummus.
- Yeah? Where is your neighbor from? - Um...
Uh, Israel, I think.
- You think? - Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
She's from somewhere over there.
You do know Israel's not really the middle East, right?
Oh yeah?
Because you said middle eastern food.
I thought you said middle eastern food.
Forget it. Let's eat.
- Mmm. - Richard?
- Yeah? - About the hummus...
Hummus isn't from Israel.
I mean, yes, Israelis do have hummus, but they took it from us.
Oh, Samara, I never said I-I...
I have no idea where hummus comes from.
And that is why I'm telling you. Hummus is from Lebanon.
- Or perhaps Syria or even Palestine. - Okay.
But not Israel.
- That's my point. - Okay.
The word "hummus" means "chickpea" in Arabic, do you know that?
No. I do now.
"hi. I was in the neighborhood"
And, um, can we talk a moment?
I just want to clarify. L-let's clarify.
I'd like to clarify the terms of our arrangement...
Um, who talks to who and what and wh...
"when and how."
Uh... "hi.
Let's talk."
"hi, Frances."
- Can I help you? - Uh, sorry.
- Wrong house. - Hey, do I know you from somewhere?
Aren't you a sub, West Lakefield high?
Hey!
I can see it starting here on the inside of your arm as well.
Oh God.
You look familiar to me. Do you play squash?
Oh no, no squash. I'm completely uncoordinated. Hmmm.
I did just buy a new perfume. Maybe that's...
Did you put the perfume on these areas?
No.
But I did start using a new detergent.
Maybe that could be the cause?
It could be, but I doubt it.
What about stress?
Any new stress in your life lately?
Stress?
No.
No, I'm not actually under any kind of stress.
My life is actually pretty stress-free.
Yeah.
- My life, my marriage is... - Didi fanning.
Do you know Didi?
Huh-uh.
Okay. Have you ever had a rash like this before?
I... I did.
- A few years back. - And did you see a dermatologist then?
Yeah.
- Do you remember the diagnosis? - I don't. I don't remember.
- No, Hmm. - That's okay.
Do you remember the doctor?
I don't remember his name.
I do remember that he prescribed an ointment that really helped.
I think it was called
Protopic...
Tacrolimus.
3%.
So it's a neuton, Ray. It's green!
You know, we can't spend our time on earth
Just taking and taking.
We have to give something back.
You know, for the children.
It's a... it's a gift. It's for you.
Thanks.
You sure you have the money for this thing?
You're my friend. But, Ray, um...
I owe you an apology.
I know you don't want me to fail.
You were pissed and it's okay.
So you're not mad at me?
No, I'm not mad.
Well, I'm not mad at you either.
Listen, from now on,
When we get a client,
I'm gonna keep her, okay? Whatever it takes.
Whatever it takes.
Okay.
And I'm sorry. You know, you earned that Frances money
And I blew it. It won't happen again.
But, hey, look on the bright side... Mike's wild about Frances.
I mean, we might have done a good thing without even knowing it.
So... How about that, happiness consultant?
That's super.
Can I use your bathroom? oh God.
You are not a bad person. You are not a bad person.
Not a bad person.
Ray, Ray, where did you get this?
- What? - This sweater.
It's Lenore's lanvin sweater.
I guess she...
Maybe she left it.
In your bathroom?
Well, I mean, she... maybe she got hot.
Hey, Tanya,
She came over to tell me about a client.
It's no big deal. It's no big deal.
It's a big deal to me, Ray. It's a big fucking deal to me. ♪ c-c-c-come on ♪
So you changed your mind. ♪ here we go, come on, rock the show. ♪
Tanya found your sweater, Lenore.
Oh God, I thought I'd lost it.
You're complicating my life in a way I don't need right now.
Last time I checked you didn't say no, Ray.
Well, I'm saying no now.
No! No more sex between you and me.
And you know what? I think it's time that she gets a commission.
I will rip his balls off and shove them up his ass.
Is that Tanya?
I will murder every Koontz cunt whore
Fuck whore in his whole fucking family.
Where is your alcohol, Ray? Do you have alcohol?
Beer, something, anything.
Here. Are you okay?
No, Ray.
I am not okay. My husband
Fucks prostitutes and pays them on their PayPal account.
He is the lowest form of human life.
Oh God, wow. I'm sorry to hear that.
- You're sorry to hear that? - Oh yeah.
My husband is a whorefucker, Ray!
He has this at home, but he prefers dirty whores.
Why, Ray? Why would he do that?
Well, I don't know, it's just...
Boy, I'm... I don't know.
- It's just sometimes... - what?
Well, um mm yeah.
It's... it's not always...
- You know. - No, Ray, I don't know.
And do you know why I don't know?
Because you haven't said anything!
- What is this? - Uh...
Oh it's, uh, hummus.
This is Arab hummus, Ray.
Arabs can't make hummus for shit.
You want hummus, you have me make it for you.
I thought hummus was from Lebanon.
What?
I mean, you know.
H-hummus... it means chickpea in Arabic. T?
Oh my God, I can't believe I fucked such an idiot.
No, okay, I might not be the middle East expert,
But what are you getting so worked up for?
I am sick and tired of Arabs
Laying claim on what the fuck is not theirs!
And if you're naive and uneducated enough to listen,
Then I have no time for you. Fuck you!
And fuck your Arab hummus!
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Fuck!
I'm sorry if I was too loud.
What the hell you got to say sorry for?
Well, sometimes I...
I've been told I come too much. can't a woman come too much.
Baby, that shit was beautiful.
Well, thank you.
I fucked a pimp.
A pimp fucked a pimp.
Yeah, we're both pimps.
We're two pimps fucking like pimps.
- You like that, don't you? - What?
Fucking me 'cause I'm a pimp.
I see it's got you all excited.
- I'm like a checkmark
On your bucket list on your little cultural tourism expedition.
- That's not what this is about. - Hey, we're all cultural tourists.
And I just fucked an artsy white lady. Check.
- I'm not a cultural tourist. - I'm teasing you.
- Come here. - But I'm serious.
Come here.
I mean you... you have...
- What? - You've made a big difference in my life.
- Hmmm. - And just right now
I'm getting fucked from all sides.
Even Frances. I went to her house
And Mike was there and it was a weekday
And she didn't pay me. She paid me for the weekend.
People don't respect you because you half-ass things.
I don't. I don't half-ass things.
I go all out all the time.
I tell you to take action and you steal some bitch's dog.
You know what I would do with this Frances?
Here. I would go up to her rich-ass door.
I'd knock very politely.
And if your ho answers, I'd crack him on the nose,
Kick him in the balls, burn his cheekbone with my cigarillo.
And if the blue hair answers
I'd hit her with my belt...
Just a little, nothing serious,
But hard enough that she don't ever pull this kind of shit again.
I can't hit Frances with a belt.
No, I'm saying that's what I would do.
You gotta find what's right for you.
Oh, I'm so glad you made it.
Are you sure it's okay I'm here?
Of course! We love new faces.
I'm not going to speak. I didn't finish the book.
Nobody cares, Jess.
Just nod and say "it's lyrical."
Okay?
- Frances! - Hello.
- Wasn't the book amazing? - Honestly I didn't care for it.
Right. The apocalypse.
Anyway the last time we spoke,
I knew you had some reservations and I just wanted to check back in.
- About God in the desert. - Oh.
But I'm dealing with your former intern now.
- She said I had to choose. - Excuse me?
She's made arrangements.
To tell you the truth, I'm quite content.
- Do you mean Tanya? - Tanya, yes.
Okay, ladies, we can take a seat.
We'll get started.
Well, let's begin the way we always do.
Cormac McCarthy's "the road," what do we think?
It was just so bleak. I mean, I couldn't even get through it.
I found the cannibalism so unappealing.
The cannibalism was very unappealing.
You want to know what I think?
I think if there was an apocalypse
And that guy and his kid crossed my path and I was hungry,
I would hunt them down and I would rip them limb from limb
And I would salute them with some kale in a light white wine sauce.
And then I would take the kid's skull
And I would wear it
So that everybody would think twice before they crossed me.
Then I would take the dad's bones and I would
Design an accessory line that I would sell from a bombed-out Macy's
Because that's what's going to happen to people who try to take what's mine.
When the apocalypse comes I'll be fine. what about all of you?
Tell me about your friend.
- What friend? - Your neighbor.
- You want to talk about her? - I do.
Uh, but right now
- I'm with you. - Are you close with her?
Um, close? No no, she's...
She's my neighbor.
She's married.
Just a married Israeli who brings over her hummus?
- Just a couple of times. - What else does she bring you?
Samara, what does it really matter?
We're having a good time here.
What does it matter? Do you watch the news?
What does the news have to do with us?
You can't fuck her and fuck me and then play neutral, Richard.
That's not how it works. You can't pull that shit.
I... I'm not pulling anything.
Then choose a side.
You fucked me and pretended to like me.
Now you've got to take a stand.
Whose side are you on, Richard? Whose hummus is better?
- Wow, Samara. - Whose hummus do you like
The most?
whose side are you on?
What kind of question was that?
Howard?
Mr. Koontz.
You all right?
- Oh, hey. - Koontz, you want a beer?
My wife thinks I fuck prostitutes, Ray.
well...
Do ya?
I'm a loser.
- Don't say that. - I know it.
My wife knows it.
They know it.
But these girls,
They're pros, Ray.
They say all the right things.
I mean,
They're hookers,
But also they're...
- They are what they are. - Right.
So am I.
They ask me every time
Do I work out at the gym?
I mean, it's pretty neat, Ray.
Do I play professional football because I'm so athletic?
I mean, come on. It's pretty neat.
They say I'm big and I'm strong and I'm handsome.
I'm the greatest lover they ever had... they tell me that, Ray.
I'm the best lover they ever had.
Well, that's gotta be pretty neat too.
They're lying, Ray.
I know they're lying, but I don't care.
They make me feel good.
I like my wife better than the hookers, Ray, I do.
But I like myself when I'm with them.
You're very pretty.
Thank you.
- You have the prettiest smile I ever saw. - Prettiest ever?
And...
You're beautiful.
And smart.
We even met in a library, right?
You're very sweet, Richard.
It's the truth.
I have a fiance.
I'm supposed to get married.
He's...
A very lucky man.
You know, my fiance,
He doesn't know.
He thinks I like...
You know.
Liz,
I'm on your side.
Okay?
I'm on your side.

On June 21st, 1974, Ricardo Morales had breakfast with
Liliana Colotto for the last time.
For the rest of his life he'd rememberevery single detail of that morning.
Planning their first vacation, drinking tea with lemon, for his nagging cough, with his usual
lump and a half of sugar.
The fresh berry jam he'd never taste again.
The flowers on her nightgown, and specially her smile.
That smile like the sunrise blending in with the sunlight on her left cheek...
No, no, no!
Please, don't!
"I FEAR"
The gates of Heaven have opened, and an angel got out.
- Esposito... - Bye, baby.
Look what the cat dragged in.
How are you, Counselor?
And you, Lieutenant? ls the boss here?
Go right in, Your Honor. Thanks, Reverend.
You look good and rested.
What a fucking asshole!
Takes one to know one.
The gates of Heaven have opened...
Your Highness.
What a surprise!
- May l? - What brings you here?
Just wanted to chat.
You busy?
Jut overpreparing for a hearing. Coffee?
I'm asking just in case retirement made you healthy.
Mariano!
Yes, Your Honor.
Bring us two of those great coffees from the cafe.
I'm typing a deposition.
A deposition?
Meet Mr. Benjamin Esposito, our recently retired royal honoris causa, and an old friend.
Mariano, our spring-summer intern.
Not bad, huh?
Here, bring some petit-fours and get yourself a candy bar.
I'll take extra cream.
That's right, you're not well.
What was your problem again?
Extra cream for the man, he has an age problem.
Yes, ma'am.
Wait. ls it important?
No.
Leave the door open, son.
Come on, sit down.
What do you know about writing novels?
I've been writing all my life.
Take a look in the archive.
Oh, the case files.
How many pages will your file be?
Does it have a cover?
A little encouragement would be nice.
What should I do? Act like some unwanted retiree who wants to help out?
Serve coffee?
I want to write, so what?
I want to write about the Morales case.
I don't know why, it's been on my mind.
We actually never talked about it.
Why was that?
With your handwriting, it'll be unreadable.
Wait, look.
My biggest problem is that I've started fifty times and never got past the 5th line.
At this rate, I'll spend my whole pension fund on spiral notebooks.
Come here, give me a hand.
Here, let me.
I can't...
It weighs a ton.
I can't believe it. The old Olivetti.
It was in storage.
I think it's 100 years old.
Think they fixed the "A"?
The "A" is for pansies.
Take it. Dinosaurs have to stick together.
Now I'm out of excuses.
I'll have to write.
But where do I start?
Wherever you remember the most.
Itwas over 20 years ago. Which part comes back most often?
That's the image you should start with.
It's a start.
This is your new boss, fresh out of Harvard
Miss Irene Menendez Hastings
"Hastings"
It's pronounced "Hastings."
Sorry.
Hastings, the new clerk.
Your deputy, Benjamin Esposito.
Actually I went to Cornell, not Harvard.
Pablo Sandoval, deputy clerk, your humblest servant.
Hey!
Are you here?
Yes, it's just that...
I remember plenty of beginnings, but I'm not sure they have to do with the story.
Then start at the beginning and stop dwelling on it.
Blood Bank, good morning.
Mr. Esposito...
The 25th called. A homicide.
Court 18. It's their turn.
They said it's rape and murder.
Court 18.
Good morning.
Hi, fellas.
Good morning.
Ma'am, did a saint die this morning?
Why?
Because an angel in mourning just walked in the door.
Ah, no.
It's just a trick we angels have to look 5 pounds lighter.
Can you bring in the Chavez file?
Of course.
You smooth fucker.
Why?
Why?
You have a compliment ready the moment she walks in the door.
How do you do it? Well, I may dress like a toad, but I'm actually Prince Charming.
- Mr. Esposito! - What?!
Counselor Romano...
He told them it was our turn.
Counselor Romano? Tell him Sheriff Esposito is gonna fuck him up.
- Okay - Come back here.
Three hours thinking of what to say, she opens the door and...
I freeze up.
It's easier for me, I'm not in love.
Neither am I, moron.
Go on.
I want you to get the files and put them on this side.
All together, it's simple enough.
Romano, what did you tell the Precinct?
It's your turn.
We're alternating.
We got another case, what's the problem?
A mini-mart robbery, smart-ass. Alternating similar cases.
What do you want me to do?
Ask Judge Fortuna.
I want a solution, not two problems.
Why is asking me a problem?
It's not that.
It's just silly to bother you with something trivial like this, if we can handle it ourselves.
Strictly speaking, it's your turn.
And hurry up, or you'll find a wake instead of a crime scene.
What's up, Baez?
Still here. And you?
Tired of being happy.
You look happy.
As a dog with two tails.
I just love it when that moron sends me to see a dead girl
Come on in.
Morons are a dime a dozen.
Quiet, easy-going ones who know they're morons.
Live and let live.
They're useless but harmless.
They don't bother. - How are you, lnspector? - Talking about you.
Then there are morons who think they're geniuses.
They shit everywhere and someone has to wipe their asses.
Of those morons I know not one, but two.
The judge and my buddy at Court 18, who's either a moron, a son of a bitch, or both.
It was his turn, so I'm asking you to tell the Judge.
Tell him I have nothing to do with...
Liliana Colotto, 23 years old, teacher,
Recently married to Ricardo Morales, bank clerk.
The old lady mentioned two builders working on the terrace in number 3, but they haven't shown up in 2 days because of the rain.
Sure she didn't see them? She says no.
I'll go see the husband.
See you, Esposito. I'll go with you.
Good afternoon,
Ricardo Morales?
That way.
- Ricardo Morales? - Yes, that's me.
lnspector Baez, Federal Police.
Anyone else have a key to your home?
See any strangers around the last few days?
The neighbor said you came home every day at lunchtime.
Out of the way, isn't it? Any reason in particular?
Sorry, I didn't get that.
We had a habit, a routine.
We liked watching The Three Stooges together.
She thought they were funny.
You'll have to come with me to the morgue.
We'll do the best we can,
I know it's unpleasant.
What is wrong with this typewriter?
Could you please get rid of it? I can't take it anymore.
- Who will want it? - I don't know.
Just get it out of my sight.
Okay, Benja, see if you like this.
With this statement,
I, Criminal JudgeRaimundo Fortuna Lacalle, hereby declare myselfcompletely insane and incapable...
That's wrong.
Give it here. It goes like this:
Pursuant to articles 1 41, 1 42 and 1 43 of the Civil Code,
MY RULlNG -in capital letters- is that Raimundo Fortuna Lacalle, is mentally ill,legally-speaking, insane, suffering from chronic delirium and is therefore unable to carry out his functions as a civil servant."
How are things, Miss? Plenty of signatures?
Yes. We have the Nicolosi case.
No big deal, Your Honor.
Witness statements, nothing more.
Very good.
Sorry, there's one file left,Your Honor.
Thank you.
Hello, Your Honor.
- How are you? - Fine, you?
- Benjamin, Pablo... Ma'am. - Hello.
Hey, Benjamin... just to show you Court 18is acting in good faith, remember you were upset the other day over getting a case?
Well, the case has been solved.
Two builders working in number 3.
They're under arrest in the 25th.
Whenever you have a chance, you can bring them in to question them.
Hold on...
What builders?
Their names are...
Jacinto Caceres, Bolivian, 35 years old.
Juan Robles, 34.
At least he's Argentinean.
I'm blown away, Romano.
Keep this up and I'll give Court 18 all the hard cases.
Bad news for you, son.
Please, sir.
Always happy to help out.
Esposito, how are you?
Romano warned you I was coming?
I was already typing the report.
You'll get the guys tomorrow: it's them, they signed a confession.
Monday at the latest.
Let me in.
Sergeant Sicora has to authorize it.
Sicora is about to eata plate full of shit. really,
You wanna go join him?
Go right ahead.
Two for the price of one.
Well?
Are you Caceres?
No, I'm Robles, he's Caceres.
Caceres, it's okay.
You stupid son of a bitch!
Are you fucking sick or what?
You arrested two nobodies!Nobodies!
They weren't even there!
Let them go, what do I care?
You ordered it beat the hell out of them!
Know where I'm going? To file a complaint!
We'll see who saves your ass this time!
Fuck your complaint!
Don't worry, you're going to.
Go file it.
All this fuss over two lousy blacks!
Your eyes will be black when I'm done with them!
Knock it off!
You better check the wanted ads.
You'll never set foot here again!
You don't know who you're fucking with!
You have no idea.
Benjamin...
It's okay,
I'm going to file a complaint.I'll be right back.
Fine by me.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
- Did you see Sandoval? - He left.
- Where? - Down Talcahuano.
This country is upside down.
You're upside down.
How can you defendthisdemagoguepresident of ours?
Watch what you say,you'll get into trouble.
Attention, everybody, please.
Chief Justice Benjamin Espositojust walked in the door.
Hail, Your Honor.
Oh come on...
How much does he owe?
Nothing, nothing at all,
I pay for my own drinks, you know that.
Besides, it's early. What's the big deal?
I'll pay for it, here I go.
That's it. No no, I have money...
It's paid.
Fine. ln that case, Mr. Esposito can buy everybody a round...
No no...
Thanks!
Hands off, hands off, you're not the boss in here, don't embarrass me in front of my friends, got it?
I'll never spot you money again. Why do you keep screwing around?
Okay, okay, let's go.Slowly, everything's fine.
It's fine.
We're leaving.
Come on.
I'm going... well, see you.
Here we go. Goodbye!
My jacket.
I've got it.
See you, Emilio.
Bye...
Why don't you two speak? You're his wife and this is his home..
You bring him at this hour,I don't know where he's been... You bring him now, I don't know what to do.
It's early, you should thank me.
You can't drop him off like this.It's your problem.
Mine?
You brought him like this.
You mean it's my fault?
Who is it?
Benjamin Espósito.
Who?
From the courts, remember?
Pretty, wasn't she?
Very.
I really am sorry for those guys.
They should be getting out by now. habia que esperar a que They had to be checked by forensics for that lawsuit I mentioned.
No, keep looking.
That way you'll get to know her better.
Here's another album.
I look at her picturesall day long
I know I'm in denial, but... it helps me go on until we find the guy.
That's when she graduated.
Then she came from Chivilcoyand moved in with her aunt.
She worked in a school in Almagro, that's how we met.
She used to pay her billsat the bank.
I still don't know where I got the courage to talk to her.
Tell me one thing.
When we get this guy, what will he get?
Rape and homicide.He'll get life.
We don't have the death penalty.
I don't agree with the death penalty.
Me neither.
I thought maybe for you it could serve as retribution.
Retribution? Will they rape himand beat him to death?
No, they'll give him an injectionand he'll take a nap.
It's not fair.
I'd gladly trade places with him.
Those are from whenshe was 1 7 or 18.
That's the spring picnic in Chivilcoy.
Ever been there?
No.
I have, she took me to visit her folks.
Let him grow old.
Live a life full of nothing.
What is it?
Nothing...
Did she have any brothers?
No, why?
Do you know who this is?
He's in several. Looking at her.
I showed Liliana this system, otherwise, years pass and you forget who's in the photo.
True...
Laporta, Rodriguez, Cardozo, Simone...
Here it is.
Gomez, lsidoro Gomez.
Well?
I always thought the photo thing was a bit crazy.
Yeah, but I think... it's the look in their eyes.
That's the key.
You see this kid looking at this woman...
Worshipping her.
The eyes...
Speak...
They bullshit too, they should keep quiet.
Sometimes it's better not to look.
What?
We never talked about this case.
When did you come back from Jujuy?
ln '85.
Why now?
Better than planting begonias...
Why?
Because I've been sidetrackedfor over 20 years.
Courts, cases, friends, pranks,
A marriage, several affairs...
I got sidetracked.
And now that I'm retired, nothing sidetracks me.
I was in a bar the other night and I saw myself having dinner alone...and I didn't like myself.
I know it doesn't happen to you.
I'm not asking you to understand.
And in trying to... find the reasons,the moments...
Everything
leads me Morales.
It's as if my life had...
Answer it. It's Alfonso, I'll call him back.
Answer it, I'll wait. I'll call him back.
It's no problem, answer it.
I'm finishing up here,I'll be right there.
Start without me,I'll be right there.
lHi?l
Good evening.Does lsidoro Gomez live there?
Yes...
- ls he home?
- No, he doesn't live here anymoreá
No?
No, he moved away, to Buenos Aires.
Ah... Buenos Aires?
Who's calling?
I'm calling on behalf of Councilman Mendez, it's for a job.
Has he been in Buenos Aires long?
A month, a little longer.
Do you know where I can find him?Have you got an address?
This job is pretty urgent.
He's working on a construction site.
On a site?
Yes, he said it was...
Montevideo, near Lanoes...
I don't remember very well, but...
What type of job is it?
It's a job that will interest him.
It's for Councilman Mendez and...
Tell me something.
Yes...
Were he and Liliana Colotto friends?
They used to see each other.She's from here.
Why?
She works for the councilman.
She's the one who recommended himfor the job.
She did, did she?
He'll be glad to hear that.
Really? Do you thinkhe'll remember her?
Oh, yesÉ He really liked that girl.
But then she moved away...
To Buenos Aires, and they never saw each other again, I think.
Hello... Hello?
Hello! lf he's here, it's a miracle.
Schmuck.
Poor guy. lmagine losing the love of your life.
Not him, you.
lf you'd kept your mouth shut and called me first without saying anything.
Morning, we're looking for lsidoro Gomez.
What is it?
Who are you?
Mike Hammer, asshole. Did he come to work?
No he didn't. We know nothing about him.
Give me his address.
Right away.
Fernandez! Fernandez!
We know Gomez got a phone calilast night.
He went in the bedroomand came out 10 minutes later with his coat and suitcase packed.
The foreman says they owed hima week's pay but that he left without any fuss.
I can ask around if you want,lnspector.
I saw the same photographs you did.I should have picked him out.
Forget it, Esposito.That case is nothing but hot air.
lf you think I'll do all that paperworkto issue a request in Chivilcoy to search some old lady's house to find letters the son may or may not have sent and yadda, yadda, yadda...Please, Esposito.
You're nuts.
We have nowhere else to look, sir.
Your little game of Don Quixotewith Romano was enough.
Poor guy got transferred to bumfuck, lowa.
Or maybe he's in Chivilcoy,try asking him.
Anyway... the general saidwhat he had to.
Oh well...
I don't know what to do.
Morales is getting worse every day, the murderer knows we're after him, my judge is a moron, I want to kill Irene, and the only guy I can trustin this world is a drunk, a total fucking imbecile.
I have an advantage.A small one, but an advantage.
Today's the 28th, right?
The drunk idiot hasn't got paid yet.
Last month's he already drank.
So when it's time to pay the bill,he'll have a dilemma.
Either he says he's broke,gets arrested, beat up, goes home a mess and his wifekicks him out for good, or he turns to his boss the chump,who happens to be me, and asks him to pay.
But one thing.
Since his bossis a chump, but not a complete chump, he'll pay one last time.
But in exchange for a favor.And the drunk idiot can't say no.Isn't that right?
I gotta pee.
Hold on. The old lady has to come out at some point.
Too much Napoleon Solo and Perry Mason.That's your problem.
I'm serious, I gotta take a leak.
Son of a bitch!Damn you!
Damn you!
You scared the fucking crapout of me!
I scared you?What are you doing here?
I came to help you.
You're supposed to keep watch outside. lf she comes back, we're screwed.
She ain't coming back.
How do you know?
She's in the grocery store,she'll be a while.
Calm down, for God's sake.
Did you find anything?
The letters...
Huh?
The letters, but no... Come here...
There's no address.
This one's from the other day.
So?
It's recent!
The trash. The envelopesmay still be in the trash.
So! No, nothing here!
Nothing at all?
Nothing.
Did you go through it?
Wanna try?
Knock it off!
Go on!.... What is it? Come here!
Calm down, I'll let you out.
Easy! Want me to drive?
The dog probably had rabies,you're gonna die.
Why didn't you keep watch?
lf she finds out we broke in...
Benjamin, as soon aswe came for the letters, sooner or later she'd realize.
That's why we didn't take the letters.
You weren't stupid enoughto bring them, were you?
Ah... And what if I did?
What if?
What if?
lf she finds out, she'll tell Gomez and the guy will disappear for good.
Don't you see?
No.
You don't?
You're fucking blind!
Because you...
You'll see, when I figure it out... The whole thing about the date...
I'd much rather work alone!
Tactical Revolutionary Command,may I help you?
Wrong number.That's quite all right.
Nothing at all?
Or I'm missing something.
It's like the guy knew we were going to read the letters.
It's just names.Bullshit, nothing concrete.
"Don't worry about me.I'm like Manfredini, not Bavastro."People from Chivilcoy.
Here, let me see.Oh, shit...
Sperm Bank, loan department.Good morning... We borrow sperm.
Deposit or withdrawal?
Esposito!, Sandoval!
Wrong number... Sandoval!
Judge Fortuna wants to see you.
You hear my voice when I speak to you,don't you, Esposito?
Yes, sir.
Then I have to assumethat if I tell you something and you do exactly the opposite, it's not that you didn't hear me but that you could give a flying fuckabout the order I gave you.
lsn't that right, Esposito?
Not quite like that, sir.
And if my colleague from Chivilcoycalls me very angry to tell me that two of my employees broke into some poor old lady's house, that means what I say isn't wortha bucket of shit.
I don't know where your colleaguecould have heard such a thing.
That's exactly what I told him,Esposito.
However, my colleague tells me that the other day in Chivilcoy at the intersection of Franciso Saveyand the corner of Schiaffino in the city limits of Chivilcoy a black Peugeot was parked with aBuenos Aires license plate number 133-809, and my colleague asks the Federal Policeto run a background check on the vehicle.
Guess whose name the car is registered to?
Tell me, who?
A certain...
Espo...
Esposi!
To.
And the Federal Policetell him where he works.
And the judge calls meto see if I can clear things up.
And the truth is, Esposito, I can't.Because I don't look like a judge anymore, I look like afirst class fucking idiot.
Because I say I want Aand I people give me z.
Just like this piece of shittypewriter they gave me!
Excuse me, sir, but...
I think something weirdis going on here.
Exactly. Wait, wait. Wait a minute.You ain't heard nothing yet.
After you can go right back to treating me like a fucking idiot.
But listen to this.
Because what stood out most in that little town wasn't the two guys from Buenos Aires, no.
Or that one of them was seen tYlng his shoelaceswhen he was wearing loafers.
What stood out most was that one of themwalked into the grocery store, greeted them pleasantly, asked for a bottle of whisky and left drinking straight from the bottle.
Shall I describe him for you?
We have to deny it, Benjamin."Itwasn't me, I don't know..."
Don't ever talk to me again.
Never again.
Deny everything.
Ma'am, honestly...
Get out of my sight.
Are you against us too?
Irene, I'm talking to you!
Irene!
Not only was it a stupid move, but you did it behind my back.
I didn't think you'd be...
You think I'm here to joke around.
I didn't say that. You didn't need to. I can tell.
Let's get this straight.
I'm the boss and you're the employee.
Twelve letters.31 pages on thin paper.
He mentions 5 jobs,two as a builder, one delivering groceries,two without details.
Three neighborhoods in Buenos Aires:Monte Grande, San Jus to and Avellaneda.
Six names: Anido, Mesias, Oleniak, Manfredini,
Bavastro y Sanchez.
Only one reference to a woman:Rosa, apparently an aunt.
That's it. That's all I've got.The rest is nothing.
Benjamin!
This is nothing too?
Please...
Leave it open, it isn't private.
I talked to Fortuna.
I explained that you're an imbecile.
I used my irresistible smile and convinced him to call the judge in Chivilcoy and forget the whole thing.
I don't know how to thank you.
I ask that you refrain from such actions in the future.
You're free to go.
One question, if I may.
Which irresistible smile? I don't think I've seen it.
Of course not. I save it for my boyfriend, as I should.
Of course.
Right. I won't take any more of your time.
And bring me the Liliana Colotto file, to seal it and archive it.
The case is closed.
Getting engaged. Kids today laugh at it.
Who gets engaged anymore?
And this kid? What was his name? He was here less than a year...
Godoy. Godoy!
-Larreta got him the job.
-That's right. Yes... Silly me, I didn't put a date on the photo.
When was it?
Two or three months after Chivilcoy.
A week later. I remember perfectly.
A week after we fought you showed up with Alfonso whatever his name was to announce your engagement.
Look at Sandoval, trYlng to look sober.
It's so weird, I don't recognize myself.
I look like someone else.
Who were you? What were you like?
I don't know. Straight, conservative...
Stuck-up.
Structured.
lnflexible.
Young.
Young, Benjamin. I was young.
You were young, too.
Look, no gray hair.
And here, looking to the side, all serious.
I was another person.
Your novel might be really good.
But it's not for me.
You've reached the end of your life and you want to look back.
But I can't.
I have to go to work every day.
And live with this.
Itmay not be "The" Justice, but it's "some" justice.
And at the end of the day I have to go home and live with my husband... and with my children, who I adore.
My whole life I've looked forward.
"Backwards" is out of my jurisdiction.
I declare myself incompetent.
What a case, Jesus Christ.
Itnever dies.
Morales! Morales!
Hello!
How are you?
- How are you?
- Espósito
Of course. How are you? Fine, and you?
Here I am.
Would you like to sit?
Yes... How are things?
This month I'm here Tuesdays and Thursdays.
What?
ln this station.
The other days of the week I wait in the other stations.
I change it every month.
He'll have to come through eventually.
He must live out of town, he knows in the city he'd be caught.
It's been a year but I imagine you haven't stopped investigating. - right?
- No, no...
You must think I'm crazy.
No.
Don't worry about me, please. No, I won't.
The worst part is I'm starting to forget.
I have to constantly make myself remember her. Every day.
The day she was killed, Liliana made me tea with lemon.
I'd been coughing all night and she said it would help.
I remember those stupid things.
Then I start having doubts and I don't remember if it was lemon or honey in the tea.
And I don't know if it's a memory or a memory of a memory I'm left with.
Excuse me.
I need to talk to you. Come in.
Thank you.
Something happened to me yesterday.
I was up all night thinking about it.
I thought about you...
Have you ever... have you ever seen things from a different angle?
You see someone else and what the other person is going through helps you see your own life.
Go on.
Yes.
And I thought, "I have to talk to Irene."
You might get pissed at me...
Sorry.
You might want to kill me, but... I have to give it a try.
Wait a moment while I close the door.
Sandoval, I'm busy. I'll call you when I'm done.
Benjamin asked me to come.
Yes, I was hoping the three of us could talk.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I ran into Morales yesterday at the train station...
Doing what?
My crystal ball is broken.
He goes to the terminals every day looking for the killer.
Every single day after working at the bank.
You can't imagine his love.
It's touching.
It's as if his wife's death just left him there, stopped, stuck in time forever.
You should see his eyes.
They're in a state of pure love.
Can you imagine a love like that?
Unaffected by the wear and tear of the routine?
Speak for yourself, it doesn't affect mine.
We think the guy deserves another chance, ma'am.
Where do I come in?
The case is closed. We'd have to reopen it.
You're asking me to destroy an official document, with mine and the judge's signature on it... and to falsify statements and dates so it will look like the case is still open?
That's a brilliant idea. We hadn't...
Don't fuck with me.
Everything okay, sir?
Tell me.Decime... Did you see a stack of letters on my desk?
No.
Sandoval?
He left down Talcahuano.
Not only do you sneak off to get drunk, you also steal evidence.
Everything's under control. lf Irene reads the file...
Hands off. Are you nuts?
We're going back.
Sit down for a second. Sit down and take it easy.
Know why we can't find him, Benjamin?
Because we're stupid.
Look:
"Twelve letters.
31 pages. Five jobs..." I already read this part.
Can we go?
Hold on a second. My mind exploded, I couldn't stop.
I kept asking myself, "Why can't we find this guy?"
He always vanishes. Where is he?
And I started thinking about guys.
Guys in general. Not just this guy, but...
Guys in general.
"The" guy.
The guy can do anything to be different.
But there's one thing he can't change. Not him, not you, not anybody.
Take me, for example.
I'm young, I have a good job, a wife who loves me...
And like you always say,
I keep throwing my life away in dives like this.
Many times you've asked, "Why are you here, Pablo?"
"Why?"
You know why, Benjamin?
Because it's my passion.
I love coming here, getting drunk, slugging it out with anyone who pisses me off...
I love it.
Just like you, Benjamin.
There's nothing you can do to get Irene out of your head.
She's dying to marry someone else, her desk drawer is full of wedding dress magazines.
She got engaged, had a party, everything.
But you keep waiting for the miracle, Benjamin.
Why?
Come here.
How's it going, notary?
How are you?
How are you?
This is that friend I mentioned, Esposito.
Andretta the notary. A real notary, and my tech advisor.
Here's my card.
Let's begin with the first letter from our friend Gomez.
It's okay, keep it.
"I swear it rained so hard I looked worse than Oleniak that night."
Notary, please.
Juan Carlos Oleniak. First played for Racing Academy in '60.
ln '62 he went to Argentinos Juniors, and back to Racing in '63.
ln a classic match with San Lorenzo, he got pushed and fell face-first into the ditch.
He was soaked.
We call him Plato. The Academy is his life.
"I'll send for you.
We make a great team.
Anido by himself isn't the same as Anido with Mesias."
Anido and Mesias, backs on the club that won it all in '61 . Negri at goalie,
Anido and Mesias. Blanco, Peano and Sacchi. Corbatta, Pizzuti, Mansilla,
Sosa and Belén.
"Don't worry about me.
I'm like Manfredini, not Bavastro." Notary?
Pedro Waldemar Manfredini.
Racing paid peanuts for him and he ended up being an extraordinary player. lncredible.
Julio Bavastro, right forward.
Played only two matches between '62 and '63 without scoring.
Quote: "I don't want to end up like Sanchez." Who's he talking about?
He can only mean the goalie, Ataulfo Sanchez.
Eternal benchwarmer.
He played only 1 7 matches between '57 and '61 .
Notary, what is Racing to you?
A passion.
Even after 9 years without a championship?
A passion is a passion.
You see, Benjamin?
A guy can change anything.
His face, his home, his family, his girlfriend, his religion, his God.
But there's one thing he can't change.
He can't change his passion.
It's a beautiful night for soccer./
Huracán hosts Avellaneda's Racing Club at Tomas Duco Stadium on a splendid night for soccer
Racing has slipped in the standings and can't waste this final opportunity
To stay in the race for the championship.
Jorge has the ball. He blows by Brindisi
lGreat move. He heads down the left sideline
lHe shakes Houseman perfectly. Centers deep to Nestor Escola.
Over to Roberto Diaz. Diaz kicks with his left...
He hits the bar! lncredible! Huracán gets away with one!
Espectacular, el público de Racing gritaba el gol...
Academy! Academy! Academy!
This is madness.
It's chaos.
You just don't know soccer.
You have to be a little more patient.
There's too many people. It's impossible.
lmpossible!
There he is!
Where?
- Over there! - Where? I don't see him.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Come on Benja... Come on...
Sorry, sorry!
lsidoro Gómez.
Come on, let's go.
What's up, Benjamin?
I'm sick of this. It's been a month.
We've been to 4 matches!
I said to be patient.
Gómez?
lGoal!!!
Racing Club scored!!!l
Damn it...
Gomez!
Come back here! Come here!
Benjamin hurry up!
I had him! He ran away!
Where's Baez?
Baez!
He ran off, did you see him?
What's he look like?
I gave you the photo!
I mean how tall is he?
Medium-height, skinny... What are they doing?
He's getting away!
I can't take it, Benjamin. What's he look like, he asks!
Son of a bitch!
He should have been there, not us!
He doesn't know him, we do!
Why didn't you give him the photo? I did!
lGo to hell, you motherfucker!l
Can't I take a crap in peace?
Come out! Fuck off! It's occupied!
Come on out, the cops are here. Nothing will happen to you.
What police? Quit fucking around.
Pablo!
Police, stop!
Stay there, don't jump!
Where is he going?
Sorry.
How's it going?
I'm waiting for Sandoval. What for?
I play the nice guy, then he comes in...
I'll explain later, it's a routine we have.
Oldest trick in the book.
You can't question him without the judge.
Of course we do!
Actually, we have to pull it off before he gets here.
Questioning a prisoner with no lawyer or judge?
Ordoñez! You seen Sandoval?
He left a while ago.
Damn it!
Itwon't stand up. What will you charge him with?
What do you mean? You think it's little to go on?
Looking at the victim in a photo?
Yes, it is.
That's why we have to soften him up.
What if it's not him? Don't look at me like that.
Eduardo!
-What if it's not him? -Of course it is.
Yes, Counselor? Don't call me that. Go get Sandoval.
Should I take a taxi? Yes. iNo! No, no...
He goes to Robertino's in the morning. in Viamonte, hurry!
No. Wait, Eduardo.
Wait, wait! What are you doing?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
It's him.
How do you know?
I don't know.
-See?
-I don't know how I know, but I know.
How?
Gomez, lsidoro Néstor.
l.D. Number.
10,7 40,925.
-Marital status?
Address.
Mocoretá 2428, lsidro Casanova.
What train do you take into town?
What train do you take into town?
I don't take the train. I take the bus.
What's the problem?
Mo, core... ah,...
This typewriter is no good!
The "A" doesn't work.
Wait, hold on.
What is this about?
Please, I beg you.
You're implicated in the Liliana Colotto case, rape and homicide.
Ithappened on June 21st, 197 4. Actually, you're the accused.
I'm going to take your statement.
You'll be assigned a public defender.
Wait, wait.
Liliana Colotto?
I knew her back in Chivilcoy.
What happened to her?
Tell me, Gómez,
Why do you think you've spent 3 days behind bars?
I have no idea. I was at the match...
Yeah, and you took off running.
What would you do? Two crazy-looking guys suddenly jump you... What happened to Liliana?
Look, Gomez, don't...
You know as well as I do you raped and killed her.
Liliana... Are you serious? I would never do that.
I haven't set foot in Chivilcoy in over a year, I can prove it.
We looked for you a week after the homicide and you disappeared, from a hostal and a job.
What hostal? I never left any hostal.
Gomez, don't play dumb. The hostal on Piedras.
That was a year ago!
I left because I couldn't afford it.
And your job?
I found one that paid better.
What's that got to do with Liliana?
I've known her my whole life, she's a friend from my childhood.
They can't find Sandoval. What?
They can't find Sandoval.
Okay, let me think...
Listen. Fortuna should be here any minute.
Please, wait for him...
Please... Huh, yeah...
You could...
Maybe... You could be right.
Itmight be preferable, more practical...
Let me see, one second.
Look, Gomez.
The judge handling your case will be here soon, so we'll wait.
Ma'am?
Sorry to interrupt, deputy, I mean, Counselor.
I know you're handling this case.
But this kid couldn't have done it.
We'll talk outside.
Wait, just a minute. Look at him.
This kid couldn't have done it.
Let me see the autopsy.
The Colotto girl... Here she is. 5 feet 6, 128 pounds.
Look what he did to her.
I'm sorry, Gomez. But I don't buy it.
The Amazon and the Pigmy?
Besides, she was a beautiful woman.
Please, look at this face.
A beauty like her isn't within just anyone's reach.
Ittakes a real man to hook a woman like that.
You think so? I mean...
The door wasn't forced.
That means she knew her assailant.
Yes.
But there's no way such a woman would ever remember this twinkie!
Unless she was a hooker.
Some guys you only do for money.
Who is she?
Keep your fucking mouth shut.
No, she was a decent girl, I assure you.
I agree with the kid about that.
She was two-timing that bank clerk for sure.
I'll bet his horns were so big he needed a convertible.
What are you laughing at, retard?
That guy who gave testimony last time.
Sandoval?
Right. I bet it was him. He was her lover.
Tall, good-looking, broad shoulders.
A man truly capable of warming up a woman.
Look at this pussy.
I'll bet when she saw him she thought,
"Oh, no, it's that schmuck who always makes mushy faces in all the photos."
lsn't that right?
Yes or no?
That's how I wanted you motherfucker!
Get him out of here!
I caught you motherfucker!
Get him out, please!
You people are crazy.
Listen, Benjamin.
"The damage to the right parietal bone demonstrates the assailant had extraordinary upper body strength."
Look, two noodles.
"Likewise, due to the depth of her vaginal injuries, we may deduce that the assailant was very well-endowed."
Obviously they're not talking about this microbe.
He must have a peanut.
There it is, bitch. How do you like it?
Sweetheart, you'll never reach the piñata. First, you're too short.
Second, you're not man enough for a real woman like me.
Not man enough? Fucking bitch! I fucked the shit out of her!
I fucked the shit out of her!
I fucked her brains out!
Stop, stop, let him go...
Let him go, Benjamin!
Let go of me!
Touch her and I'll kill you. I'll kill you!
Are you Espósito?
Are you Espósito or are you Espósito?
Hello?
It's me, did I wake you?
No, no...
I was working a bit.
Why are you up so late?
I was thinking...
You don't say.
Yeah, silly. No, about the novel.
I want to read it when it's finished.
Great, I'd love that!
Sure you don't want to talk a little while?
No, I'll drink my tea and see if I can get back to sleep.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
This morning, at the presidential residence in Olivos, the president,
Doña Maria Estela Martinez de Perón...
Irene, Irene!
The dressmaker is here!
Look, she made the cape like you wanted!
Come on and try it on.
I'll be right in.
municipalities and public facilities located across the country.
She personally delivered clothing, school supplies and candy
It be distributed in Lobos, a village in the province of Buenos Aires.
Hello?
Morales, how are you? It's been ages, what a surprise!
Yeah, I'm watching it, but I turned it down.
What? And also, thanks to them, we can achieve many things,
lbecause people can't do it all on their own.
They help a lot to get everything done.
Good morning.
Miss Menendez Hastings, from Court 42.
We're here to see Mr. Romano.
He's very busy.
What's it about?
Sir! Sir!
You can't go in there!
I'll leave my credentials, don't worry.
These two, raising their hands.
I want you to get them.
Just go and find them.
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?
No, you are.
Ma'am!
We need to talk to you.
Fellas, would you mind?
lf you'd called first, I'd have had coffee ready.
lsidoro Gómez. Rape and murder, arrested by the court.
Penitentiaries informed us he's been freed by Executive Order.
We checked, and here we are.
Anything to say? Yeah, sure. That you two need to get out more.
Justice is nothing but an island.
This is the real world.
While you two are shooting birds, we're in here, fighting in the middle of the jungle.
Gómez, Gómez, Gómez...
Yes...
He started working with us when he was in jail.
He'd give us information, spy on young guerrillas...
He did good work! We like him. What's the problem?
Don't you agree?
Do you realize what you're saying?
He's confessed, He's a convicted murderer.
Perhaps, but he's also intelligent and brave.
He can break into a home and get the job done.
His personal life is his own business, right?
With all the subversives out there...
Who cares?
lf we only used good guys...
He was arrested under Judge Fortuna's jurisdiction, and we want--
Do you think I don't know you let him go to get back at me?
You think I'm stupid?
That's two questions.
Which one shall I answer first?
ls that true?
Ma'am...
Would you do me a favour?
What are you gonna do, file an appeal?
No offense, but there's nothing you can do.
Except go back to your office, take a seat, and watch and learn.
They don't teach the new Argentina at Harvard.
And why do you come with her?
You think it gives you immunity?
Leave her alone, she's out of your league.
She studied law, you barely finished high school.
She's young, you're old.
She's rich, you're poor.
She's Menendez Hastings and you're Esposito, a zero.
She's untouchable, you aren't.
Let her go back to her world.
But if you have a problem with me, come alone and we'll settle it.
Come on, Irene.
Let's go.
You do have one thing in common.
Neither of you can do a thing about it.
You said life.
Yes, he should get life.
Well, then?
These people don't give a shit about justice.
And where he is now, we can't get anywhere near him.
lf I could, what for?
What would I do?
What would four bullets get me?
A lifetime in jail.
Gomez goes free without ever serving and I spend 50 years stuck in a cell, envYlng him...
No.
No, life in prison would have been fair.
I wish I could help, but I honestly don't know how.
Who knows? Some other time...
Anyway!
I'll get it.
No, please. It's just a coffee.
I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me.
I wouldn't have made it this far without you.
I owe you one.
Counselor, sir.
It's about the lgarzabal file, sir.
Stop calling me Counselor, would you already?
lf you do it in front of the judge I'll get in trouble.
What about the file?
Have you made a copy?
I'm on it.
You'd have to be there, but you're here!
Come on!
Benjamin...
Yes?
How long before you talk to me again?
I talk to you every day.
I'm not untouchable.
Or from another world.
lf only you were... Irene, let's drop it.
Drop what?
You're marrYlng the engineer, zapiola Menendez Urtubiea and so on.
You're not jealous...
For God's sake. I hope you live happily ever after.
Any objections?
No, none.
Go on, object.
Irene, please...
What are you looking at?
What do you want? Go away!
Where can we meet?
What for?
So you can present your objections about my life, my fiancé, my marriage and anything else related to the case.
We coulf meet for coffee after work.
Time. Eight thirty.
Place? Los lnmortales.
La Richmond.
Sorry, my suggestion wasn't very elegant.
No, Benjamin. Somewhere far away from here.
Who are you spying on?
Sorry. Phone call for you, sir.
From a bar?
Pablo Sandoval. You cocksucking bastard.
Wash your fucking mouth!
No, Benjamin... I can't believe they called you.
Damn it!
I told everyone...
"Don't bother my friend, this is a man's job!"
You're not a man, you stinking drunk.
What? Me, drunk?
Fuck you!
Fascist! Fascist!
He's a Nazi!
Listen, officer.
We're from Court 42, I'll handle it.
Don't worry.
Come with me. Arrest the motherfuckers!
Show them some fucking justice!
Come here! My jacket, my jacket! You're wearing it.
What time does your wife get home?
At eight.
How odd.
There's no answer...
My mouth is dry... Have you got any...?
There's no answer!
Leave that alone!
She's never going to answer.
Why?
Because the phone doesn't work.
Put that down!
I told you a thousand times, Benjamin.
I wanted to sue their asses.
And you didn't help me.
That was six months ago!
The phone hasn't worked for a year!
Motherfuckers never fixed it!
Damn it!
You can't spend the night here.
Put that down!
Stop touching stuff.
lf you ever called me, you'd know it doesn't work.
Leave that.
What are you looking for?
I wanted to sue them.
Look at me. You have a date?
No, no!
You have a date.
And I'm leaving... The last thing I need is you calling me a party pooper.
Damn it, too much furniture in here!
Sit here!
I always run into shit!
Have a seat until you feel better.
There...
Stay there until you feel better.
What time is it?
I have a watch in the bedroom.
What bedroom, idiot?
This is my house.
Yes...
It's alright, we're okay.
Easy...
Come on Benja...
I'll go try to convince your wife not to kill you.
Call her on the phone.
You said it didn't work.
Mine doesn't work, Benjamin...
Use yours. Just stay here.
Don't touch anything, don't do anything.
I'll be right back.
Turn off the light.
We'll catch that son of a bitch!
We'll catch him...
We were working all day...
Save it for some other time.
Please, let me explain.
It's the last time!
Okay, okay.
Be patient with him, he needs help.
He needs help? No, I know...
What I mean is, if we help him, it's easier for everyone.
You want to get rid of him. Don't say that!
What's this?
What happened?
Hold on a second. Pablo!
What happened?
I don't know!
Pablo! Don't scare me!
Hold on!
Pablo!
Hey!...
Nooo!
What, what happened?!
Nooo...
What happened? No! No, no!
What happened?
What happened? This is madness.
It will be if that bastard finds you.
He's gonna go after you.
No, my father knows who to talk to.
He works for Romano, Romano won't mess with me.
Don't worry, I'll be fine!
But, Jujuy!
For God's sake, Irene!
My cousins are like feudal lords there.
Nobody will touch you.
Not Romano, not anyone.
What will I do in Jujuy?!
Same as here.
Sign and stamp...
They have your desk ready.
No, no, no no, no Irene, I can't! I can't.
I have my life here,
I have my old man! I have everything here.
What we can do here?
Us...
We can't do anything.
Bye.
It's a rough draft.
I'll make more.
Your house is exactly as I imagined it.
How did you imagine it?
Exactly like this. Exactly like I imagined it.
Sure, I imagined your house would be totally different.
You've seen my house?
No, I mean unlike this one.
Totally different.
What does this mean?
Huh?
This piece of paper says "I FEAR"
No! No no no no... It's just something I did...
A writing excercise, half asleep...
To inspire imagination... Neve rmind.
Okay, shoot.
It's a novel, it doesn't have to be true, or even believable.
Yes...
No, what? Itisn't believable?
No, Benjamin.
That part when...
When the guy leaves for Jujuy...
What's the problem?
CrYlng like he's all broken up...
So what? Her running on the platform after the man of her dreams...
Well... Touching hands through the glass, like they're one.
And her crYlng, as if she knew her fate was mediocrity and never loving anyone, practically falling on the tracks, proclaiming love she'd never had the courage to confess...
That's what happened, isn't it?
lf that's what happened, why didn't you take me with you?
Dimwit.
How does the case proceed?
I don't know.
I can say he spent 10 years counting llamas in the Andes.
And when I came back you were D.A., married and with two kids.
Should I put that?
Or that he came back married to a Jujuyan princess, pretty, rich...
She was wonderful.
It wasn't her fault I could never love her.
It's a lousy ending. It's crap.
You see?
I don't want to miss another chance.
How can I do nothing about it?
I've been asking myself for 25 years and I've only been able to come up with one answer.
"Forget it, it was another lifetime. It's over, don't ask."
It wasn't another life time.
It was this one.
It is this one.
I want to understand. How can someone live an empty life?
How do you live a life fulI of nothing?
How do you do it?
This is a waste of time.
We'll never find him!
Trust me, remember how formal he was?
Nobody notifies a change of address. Mine's from when I danced the pata-pata.
Gomez, lsidoro. Espora 691 , Chivilcoy.
You see, that's his mother.
Sir, we are required by law to notify a change of address.
It's not something we do because we feel like it.
Understand?
I do now.
Morales, Ricardo. There's one, two... Four, ma'am.
Let's search by l.D. number.
What's your first number?
Three, what's yours?
What do you care?
I can't...?
Here's a 5 and a 6.
Morales, Ricardo Augustin.
He changed addresses in 1975.
Write this down, pata-pata.
Who are you looking for?
Morales. How are you?
Remember me?
Esposito.
From the courts... 25 years ago.
Quite a surprise. I know, sorry.
How are you?
Everything okay? Such a long time.
What a surprise! Yeah...
Come in, please.
Shall I make coffee?
Coffee?
You're not drinking mate out here?
Out here?
I'm in the bank all day long.
You're still at the bank? I'll take that coffee.
You moved out here right after.
Yes. I wanted to start over, from scratch.
That's the good thing about the bank.
They have branches everywhere.
There's always a branch nobody wants, so here I am, with a promotion and everything.
How about that...
Remember Liliana?
Yes, of course.
How are you doing?
Still here.
No, I mean single, married...
No! No, really...
I think I just...
At that point, just closed shop.
I tried, but you know what?
It's complicated.
I got married.
You don't say. Yeah, for a while, but it didn't work.
I don't know if it was me...
It's complicated. It's complicated.
Quite a story, I can't believe it.
Never thought I had a novel in me.
You should flesh it out. It's like a long memo.
Crazy.
I could never forget it.
A mistake.
You should put it behind you, trust me.
You came here because of Gomez, right?
What do you mean?
He was on the loose, he might come looking for you.
No, no.
I'm not scared of Gomez.
Maybe he's dead. Maybe.
They came looking for me. Yes, I know.
How do you know? I just read it.
They found your friend.
Yes, poor Sandoval.
Do you remember Sandoval?
No...
My coworker at the courts.
They came looking for me, didn't find me and let him have it.
Bastards!
Gómez was never found, right?
Guess.
Those guys always get away with it.
You know, there's something I need to ask you.
How did you learn to live without Liliana?
Itwas 25 years ago, Esposito.
I was sure you wouldn't be able to. Itwas 25 years ago, Esposito.
Especially with him on the loose. How did you start over?
Itwas 25 years ago!
Forget it.
lf it weren't for me, you wouldn't have made it this far.
You owe me one.
I don't know what you want me to say!
You didn't care the guy got a free ride!?
There was nothing I could do.
- No?
- No! - No!?
- NO!
You spent a year looking for the guy, they let him go and you do nothing?
I wasted a year looking for him on train stations, and they let him go!
What can I do?
That's it?
Yes!
The rest of your life behind a desk? Look who's talking.
You're better than I am.
What do you care?
It's my life, not yours.
No, Morales, it's my life too!
Your love for that woman... I never saw it again!
ln anybody!
Nobody! Ever!
Get out of my house!
Right now, please!
It's my life, not yours.
I'm sorry, I'm getting old, that's it.
That might be it...
I couldn't stop thinking about it! Go dwell on it at home!
Gómez didn't kill Sandoval.
So?
Gómez knew us both!
lf he'd been there, he'd have waited for me.
There's something...
I had a couple of photos at home, of myself.
When Sandoval got killed, the photos had been turned over.
Nothing else had been touched.
I thought...
I think...
Are you Espósito?
Huh?
Did you hear what I said, asshole? Are you Esposito?
What's going on? What are you doing?
Huh?
Answer me!
Where are you going!?
Stop it, dude...
Where are you going?
Here...
What are you going to do?
I'm going to put on a record. It's okay.
You're going to put on a record?
Listen to me, are you Espósito or not?
Yes, I am.
I'm so ashamed I can't even bring myself to put flowers on his grave.
Maybe that's not what happened.
Maybe he fell asleep and they killed him without him even realizing, somebody knocked over the photos by accident, bumped into them...
I don't know what to think anymore.
Choose carefully.
Memories are all we end up with.
At least pick the nice ones.
But there's one thing I know I'll never forget.
The last thing Pablo said to me the night they killed him.
"Don't worry, Benjamin. We'll catch that son of a bitch."
And I will.
lf he's alive, I will.
Well...
Wait, come in...
Sit down.
You can stop looking.
I couldn't go to the authorities. I knew the guy was untouchable.
But I also knew sooner or later he'd come looking for you.
lMeet you there, at nine o'clock!l
Hey, Gómez!
I got rid of the body and obviously he wasn't missed.
Was it worth it?
Forget about it! Forget it!
Who cares?
My wife is dead!
Your friend is dead!
Gomez is dead too!
They're all dead! Stop dwelling on it!
You'll start wondering if you could have stopped it...
You'll have a thousand pasts and no future!
Forget about it, trust me.
You'll end up with only memories.
I owed you one, right?
Now we're even.
lForget about it, forget it!l
I couldn't stop thinking about it./
What would four bullets get me?
It's my life, not yours.
Go dwell on it at home!
We'll catch him...
I've been wondering for 25 years.
Bye.
Itwasn't another lifetime. /t was this one./
A guy can do anything to be different.
What would four bullets get me?
But there's one thing he can't change. Not him, not you, not anybody.
How can someone live an empty life?
How do you live a life full of nothing?
How do you do it?
Please!
I fucked the shit out of her!
What retribution?
lPlease, please!l
It's as if his wife's death just left him there, stuck in time forever.
My wife is dead! Your friend is dead!
Gómez is dead too! They're all dead!
They'd give him an injection and he'd take a nap.
Nobody, Benjamin.
Let him grow old.
Live a life full of nothing.
How did you start over?
That was 25 years ago!
25 years, Esposito! iForget about it!
Please.
Tell him...
Tell him at least to talk to me.
Please...
You said life.
"I FEAR"
"I LOVE YOU"
ls she in? Yeah, in her office?
You're alive!
Yeah...
I need to talk to you.
Shall I bring coffee, Ma'am? Go away.
It'll be complicated.
I don't care.
Shut the door.
THE SECRET OF THElR EYES
Attention, please.
Change of plan.
We've put off our visit to the grotto until tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
Our journey was rather tiring, we'd all been looking forward to this, but it's too late now.
So tomorrow, our schedule will be even busier.
This is why I ask you all to make an effort, so that we can get everything done, in a cheerful manner and, more importantly, so that we can open up to one another.
Each one of us should make the most of this opportunity.
We, the helpers, but of course you, the pilgrims.
You came here to help foremost those of us who are sick, those who are in need.
They shall feel better, even if only for a few days.
They shall forget their loneliness and find some happiness and relief here.
At the end of our stay, we'll award a prize for the best pilgrim, as a reward for their good deeds.
Information about Lourdes and the apparitions can be found in this booklet.
Are you enjoying it?
Yes.
It's a bit touristy, but that's how every pilgrimage is.
Have you been on many? Yes.
It's the only way I get out.
Travelling isn't easy in a wheelchair.
You take the legs.
One, two, three...
Look here.
The wheelchair, please.
All right?
A bit higher.
That's fine, thanks.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.
Goodnight.
Do you like her?
Beautiful, isn't she?
The Virgin Mary is watching us.
Don't forget your raincoats.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women, and he whom John baptised in the Jordan, your child Jesus, is blessed.
Thank you.
Well, are you pleased to be going in?
I guess so.
They say that the last healing occurred in the baths.
What happened exactly?
There was a man who'd suffered from multiple sclerosis for years.
Apparently, it was in the baths that he suddenly recovered the use of his arms and legs.
That's how he was cured.
Yes.
I'd heard about that too.
Sorry to butt in, but it didn't happen exactly as you said.
Firstly, it happened at the blessing, not in the baths.
And secondly, his paralysis came back later.
The poor thing!
That's why it wasn't officially recognised as a miracle.
He did walk again, though?
Yes, but it didn't last. So it doesn't count.
They're very strict about that.
Next!
What if the healing does last?
It'll be all right. It'll do you good.
You'll see.
You're next.
Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us.
Saint Bernadette, pray for us.
O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us.
Lord, I have come here for a little comfort and human warmth.
Usually, I am alone.
I pray that I receive some care and attention here.
Lord, hear our voices raised in prayer.
Lord, my fiancée left me after my motorbike accident.
Let me find a new fiancée who's better able to handle my disability.
Lord, hear our voices raised in prayer.
Lord,
I sometimes feel that my life is passing me by.
I feel useless.
Please help me.
Lord, hear our voices raised in prayer.
Hear our voices.
We're going for a drink later. Want to come?
Maybe.
I bet Kuno will come too!
We'll see.
Well, are you enjoying yourselves?
Yes.
We met on the trip to Rome... didn't we?
Yes, of course.
Well, enjoy yourself.
Thanks.
In fact,
I rather prefer the cultural trips.
Everywhere is different.
Yes.
Do you want some Lourdes water?
No, thanks.
Excuse me, father.
- May I ask you something? - Of course.
I've heard that one can be healed even physically here.
It does happen...
Miraculous healing.
Yes.
I want to ask you... What do I have to do?
I believe, of course, that God can perform miracles.
But only if we open our hearts fully to His grace.
We must say, "Yes," to Him.
And what exactly must we do?
Firstly our souls must be healed.
Only then can the body be healed.
I felt a bit lost at first.
But now I enjoy the volunteer work.
And it's for a change.
Usually I go skiing during the holidays.
But sometimes I miss the meaning behind it.
Contrary to charity work.
It's important to me to have a goal, or meaning in my life.
Are you all right?
What's happened?
- What's the matter with her? - I don't know.
It's upsetting.
The tide buries us all in the end.
You gave us quite a scare.
I'll handle this.
Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
That's fine. Thanks.
And the prayer?
Sorry.
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.
Oh, sorry.
Not behind the ear.
There.
- Do you like it? - And the earrings?
Yes.
Did you have fun last night?
Good morning.
Careful, it's hot.
- Good morning. Are you well? - Yes, thanks.
Is everything all right with you too?
Do you like it here?
I had a strange dream.
I dreamt that I was paralysed and that the Virgin Mary appeared to me.
She said something, but I didn't understand very well what she said.
So I got up and moved closer.
And it was then that I realised I was no longer paralysed.
It's not easy, I know.
But we must learn to accept our fate with humility.
We pray for the healing of the soul, not that of the body.
And the suffering you bear can have a deep meaning.
Paul said,
"I rejoice in my suffering for your sake,
"and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions
"for the sake of His body, that is, the Church."
If I told you what I dreamt about last night!
Do you think he's married?
Who cares?
During the blessing there have been healings, too!
You're going too far now!
Not at all!
When the priest passes with the sanctum and he stops to bless them, sometimes people are healed.
Don't believe all you're told.
We'll see.
Here she is, the eager one!
But it won't do you any good.
Do you really think God would heal someone just because they pushed in front of the others?
In future, please don't move away from the rest of the group.
- Was it fun last night? - She doesn't remember!
Stop it!
- The girls have got to you. - Of course they have!
- Shall we go? - Yes.
- Goodbye. - Your hat.
I suggest you concentrate more on your duties.
We're not here to have fun.
Where have you been?
Are you glad to be here? It was lovely, wasn't it?
The blessing was lovely, don't you think?
Yes, it was fine. Thanks.
Are you feeling all right?
Yes.
You're all pale.
I'm always pale.
I'll give you a hand.
- Thank you. - That's what I'm here for.
- It's really nice of you. - No.
I have to atone for my sins.
Let us pray to the Lord not to despair in the face of death.
May we see the grave for what it truly is:
an in-between place, where we leave our mortal bodies.
We shall now move on to the Station of the Resurrection, for this is the truth of Christianity: eternal life.
Everyone was praying devotedly, repeating the words spoken by the priest.
I was exhausted and felt unweIl, so I couldn't pray any more.
I concentrated instead on a single thought:
"Lord, may Thy will be done.
"Virgin Mary, pray for us."
Suddenly,
I felt a bolt flash through me from my head to my feet.
Like an electric shock.
I thought it was the end.
But no, I was kneeling in front of my wheelchair, upright, with my hands together.
I don't know what happened but I knew that I was cured.
The pain was all gone.
And my limbs, which had been paralysed and flaccid, were full of renewed strength.
- Did you notice anything? - What?
The man who'd had the miracle, he was sitting down.
Yes, so?
We didn't see him get up once.
Doesn't that make you think?
Don't you think we might get lost?
The Holy Ghost, Jesus and the Virgin Mary are on a cloud, discussing their holiday plans.
The Holy Ghost says, "Let's go to Bethlehem."
Jesus says, "Bethlehem? No, we've been there lots of times."
The Holy Ghost thinks and says, "Then how about Jerusalem?"
Jesus says, "Jerusalem? No, we've been there lots of times."
The Holy Ghost thinks and says, "I've got it!
"Let's go to Lourdes."
The Virgin Mary says, "Yeah, great!
"I've never been there before!"
This morning you have free time.
You can choose between confession and going to the baths.
Benefit from this opportunity.
We'll meet at two o'clock by the Basilica of the Rosary, for the photograph.
Be on time.
- The napkin. - Oh, yes. Sorry.
I dreamt about you last night.
The Virgin Mary appeared to you and said something to you.
What did she say?
"Rise, take up your bed and walk."
So, is Lourdes better than Rome?
Let's just say that Rome is somehow... more cultural.
You're right. I prefer Rome too.
Do you prefer confession or baths?
We could do both.
Our time is limited.
Do you mind if I don't come with you?
You can't just leave her!
I'll be back!
I am often angry.
Why did I fall ill and not someone else?
Why me?
Sometimes I envy the others, those who can walk and do everything normally, without thinking.
There are some worse off than me, but I don't feel any pity for them.
I'd like to be healthy too and have a normal life.
What is that?
A "normal life"?
Your life is unique.
Each life is unique.
God created this diversity.
Each life is different, none is better than another.
Or do you think that someone who can use his legs is necessarily happier?
Let us pray together.
Lord, we pray to You.
Heal this young woman.
Heal her soul.
And, if You wish, heal her body too.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- Lucky! - That was close.
I hope that this time I'll get rid of my eczema.
- Our Lady of Lourdes. - Pray for us.
- Saint Bernadette. - Pray for us.
O Mary of the immaculate conception.
Pray for us, poor sinners.
Anna?
Anna.
A miracle?
Anna!
- What's going on? - No idea.
It's a miracle.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Hold it, ladies and gentlemen.
On three, give me a smile, please.
One, two, three...
Thank you. Have a nice day.
Let's go.
...heal also your servant from the infirmity of body and spirit that afflicts him.
Holy Father, doctor of souls and bodies, you who sent your only begotten son Jesus Christ to cure every disease and to free us from death, heal also your servant from the infirmity of his body and soul that afflicts him.
Amen.
Holy Father, doctor of souls and bodies, you who sent your son Jesus Christ to cure every disease and to free us from death, heal also your servant from the infirmity of body and spirit that afflicts him.
Amen.
For our last day, there will be an excursion into the mountains.
We shall go up the Pic du Jer.
I'm sorry, but only the most able-bodied of you will be able to come.
Those in wheelchairs must stay here.
Our closing party, on the other hand, is open to everyone.
Are you allowed?
Yes.
It's whipped cream.
- More? - Yes.
- You look so healthy today. - Thank you.
Enjoy.
I'd like a little more.
Sorry to bother you...
Could you help me prepare things for the party?
Of course. What would you like to do?
I'd like to put a paper chain over there, and maybe over there too.
And a few balloons.
Fine. When?
After the meal.
I'll finish my pudding and be right with you.
Thank you.
Father,
I have something to ask you.
Is God good or is He all-powerful?
If He's all-powerful and good, He could heal everyone, couldn't He?
He does.
But for some it's more discreet. It's on the inside, you see?
Take a person in despair, for example, who suddenly, through God's grace, finds a meaning to life.
That too is a miracle.
If you like.
- A bit lower. - Sorry.
Thank you.
Cécile...
Can I help you?
It's hot!
Could you, just a little...?
Congratulations.
From me too.
Have you been to the medical office?
No.
You ought to, or it won't be officially acknowledged.
How sad that Miss Cécile can't see this.
We must give thanks to the Virgin Mary.
And pray that it lasts.
She's the one it happened to.
It's a miracle!
We're here for a very important reason.
We have reason to believe that this young woman, contrary to all expectations, has been cured.
What should we do in such a case?
You're not the only ones today.
Next, please.
This patient's ailment goes through phases of intensification and remission.
Multiple sclerosis has its ups and downs, and this would seem to be a temporary improvement of her overall state, which will not last.
Will you stand, please?
Carry on, carry on...
Come back.
Very good.
Be careful.
You should get some rest.
Your body needs to readapt itself.
Above all else, get plenty of fresh air.
Now what do we do?
This case will have to go before a medical committee.
Such an improvement is most uncommon.
It's extraordinary.
Goodbye and good luck.
Thank you.
In fact, it happened gradually.
I could feel something in my hands after the baths.
Then, in the grotto,
I could lift my hand to touch the rocks, whereas I couldn't even lift a finger before.
After the baths? That's interesting.
Continue.
During the night I heard what sounded like a voice, telling me to get up.
So I got up and went to the toilet, as natural as can be.
As if I suddenly remembered what to do.
Like looking for your glasses when you're wearing them!
But what about inside yourself?
Do you feel a sort of illumination?
Not really.
Do you think that makes a difference?
It depends.
On what?
Let's say that it depends on the way you internalise this healing.
One may wonder whether it will reinforce your faith and make your attitude an example for all Christians.
In view of the circumstances, some of you have requested that we retake the group photo, as a way of, let's say, capturing this great event.
So I would like to see you all tomorrow after breakfast by the Basilica of the Rosary.
For the helpers...
We are now going to go to the little chapel.
We've decided to hold a novena on behalf of our Cécile, who is still, unfortunately, between life and death.
One, two, three...
Hold it, I'll take another.
On three again.
One, two, three...
Thank you. Have a nice day.
How are you? Still feeling well?
Yes, fine.
So much the better.
Yes.
You're not on the list.
She's coming instead of Cécile.
Cécile...
Carré...
I want to start a career as soon as possible.
I have the feeling great things are in store for me.
You know...
I really feel that I have a future now.
Of course.
I wish you success.
Thank you.
Or you could have a family. That's possible now, isn't it?
Yes.
That's true.
- Do you need a hand? - No, thanks.
I'm pleased for her.
She's made such an effort.
I wonder why her, and not... I don't know, let's say...
Mr Hruby?
Why Mr Hruby?
Or the girl in the wheelchair.
Her mother comes here every year.
That's not what counts, obviously.
Yes, doing too much doesn't help either. That's for sure.
Just look at what happened to Cécile.
She was at it non-stop.
Yes, but Mrs Carré pulled her weight too.
She doesn't seem very pious, our miracle girl.
Sorry to bother you, father.
But I'd like to ask you something we're all wondering about.
Why has she been cured and not...
Mr Hruby, let's say?
God is free.
His ways are often mysterious to us, when we expect everything to be explained.
Why is this person cured and not another?
That's the way life is.
One person can play the piano, another can't.
One has a gift for languages, another doesn't.
One is rich, another is not.
Thank you.
Are you all alone?
I'm thinking.
All of this is... very...
It bothers me.
Skiing must be great here in winter.
I'm looking forward to skiing again.
She'll have to come to terms with it too.
You're very special.
Really?
Really.
Getting up like that and walking.
How did you do it?
I'm so...
I'd so like to...
I'm scared of hurting you.
One, two, one, two.
One, two.
May the Lord be with you.
And with your spirit.
Something miraculous has happened.
God has sent us a powerful sign, a sign of His grace and His love.
We can see it with our own eyes.
Heaven has reached down to earth.
And what does this tell us?
That God has not forsaken us, that He is always watching over us, that He loves us.
Through this sign He has manifested His presence.
He is telling us,
"You are not alone."
Thank you very much.
I am very grateful. This is an honour for me.
I am also grateful for the grace, that I was the one to be cured.
It's given me something to think about.
Why me and not...?
But I think there's meaning to it. Well...
For me, anyway. What I mean is,
I hope to be the right person.
I am happy to award you the prize for the year's best pilgrim.
It's been good, though, hasn't it?
Yes, but tomorrow I'll be alone again.
We are not alone.
We are.
- Do you want to dance? - Yes.
I'm so happy.
Are you all right?
Yes.
- Do you want your stick? - No, thanks.
Come and sit down.
No, I'm fine.
I don't need it.
- I'll be right back. - OK.
A pity.
I almost believed it.
What do you mean?
She tripped, that's all.
Just imagine if it doesn't last.
That would be so cruel.
How can God do that?
If it doesn't last, then it wasn't a real miracle.
So He is not in charge.
Who is, then?
Do you think there'll be a dessert?
Don't shoot me. Who is that?
There's your money, release the hostage
How much in there? - Three -
You're too late.
We want five million dollars
Wha'da ya know, a greedy pirate
Last chance, take it or leave it
We want the money... now!
Goal in front of me- No!-
A little low
I'll kill him, I swear I will kill him
Drop your guns!
Fat chance - Yeah, that'll happen -
Last chance, let the hostages go or you're outta there
Bring the money here to me, Cocoa face
I'll take the four on the left
Why don't you take the two on the right leave the rest alone
I'll kill them all, I don't care
You should take the two on the right, you're not that fast anymore
The only thing faster is light
We'll see
Bullets are faster than the blades
Bring the money here!
Want money?
.
Go and Get It
(cell phone: buzz-buzz!) What's that?
Insects
Excuse me?
Kill him!
I call that a tie - Come on, you're dreams -
These guys are arrested development A little compassion, folks
Ya' know, I don't think you hit one of 'em
I don't see any knives actually
How you guys doin?
What the hell is he doin?
Hanging a pirate - Don't be rediculous
Gunner!
What are you doing?
Hanging a pirate
He's seriously demented
This is not good - You're on your own -
'Preciate it, it's good to have friends
Gunner Yeah?
This is not the way we work Let him go
Why? He'd do it to us
Gunner, last chance) .
Let him go or we let you go
It's good to hang pirates
We don't kill like that
Yeah? Not polite enough?
Let him go, Gunner - How are you a partner? -
Very Good
My partner here kicked me with steel tipped boots, can you believe that?
You deserved it
This will require stitches - Maybe -
I hate stitches
Everyone does

But, I do have a surprise
The first blend, a special
And
I have something else for you
Bought something
Surprise
It's a good color, but
It's hard to see in this light
It looked real shiny when I bought it in the shop
Grace
Is everything okay?
Yes?... - Who's he? -
He's a friend
Kinda late. You gotta name?
Friend.
She just told you
Lee, come on...
Don't leave like this. Lee, I'm sorry
I thought that things were good between us
I felt like you never cared about getting in my life, or letting me into yours. Stop!
Sure I did
No, I have known you for over a year and a half . And do not even know what your business is What's wrong?
When I am here I am with you and that is what counts
What matters is, when you're here .
You're a good man and I love you but
Grace! - I hate his voice -
Did you say something? - Don't let him come down here -
You do not understand what I'm saying, you have to understand

Welcome back, my brother,
Damn, you look good

Let's finish this bird up
Yeah, brother. It's taken you a couple of years to do a couple of letters
We had to get rid of Gunner
Yeah, well, he went crackistan on you ass you gotta cut 'em loose
Yeah, you wanna fill in?
Let me tell you something
Remember where we were last time?
Where were we?
In that mud & blood - Nigeria -
Yes, your hand was all shot to shit
And you were bleedin all over the place, and I was bleedin and ...
Since that time, I promised myself
I don't wanna die all alone full of holes in the mud and the blood
I wanna die with something that counts.
I wanna die with a woman. I wanna die, ya know, with someone who cares about me
Don't wanna die for a woman, I wanna die laying next to a woman.
It is Christmas time - .
Yes, I can smell him from here -
Mr. Christmas, how ya doin, brother?
I'm good, Toole
Take a look at this, what do you think?
Eh, it still looks like a black chicken
Black Chicken? - Black Chicken?
Yes, I'm done - It's a damn raven -
Oh, man!
Good to see ya, bud
You know what? For you
I have a great idea
Why don't you let me doodle like a ...
A Charlette's Web on your head
Something different, something exciting Because you a perfect dome muscular heads ...
I can put a web on the top of the head...
Maybe a pregnant Charlette coming out of your ear peeking around
Making sure them bugs don't come inside...
Her long legs dangling down your neck?
Yes, sexy, right? - .
Very sexy -
This will give you a little mystery, a little character and very...sexy
That will make you stand out
He's thrilled, though
Ok, tell you what
I feel a little lucky tonight
I'm feeling very acurate
Maybe another time
Come on, take him on
Come on, Christmas, bring it, baby
I am a coward in his place
He never beat you in your life - Come on, Christmas, no disgrace in losing -
Yes Good Well, I've go 3 pieces of work
Two a walks in the park And one to hell and back
I need some time alone - Hey, cheer up. Make the meeting -
General!
Now we can see inside of him
And I see lies
He wasn't stealing from you, he was stealing from us
Both
Want to rate respect?
Let's just keep it simple, if the money's right we don't care where the job is.
Let's quit jerkin' off...
Get down to business, see who's hungry.
I know your real name's probably not Barney Ross
You don't need to know my name
The only thing you need to know is that the job's real... and the money's real.
And since we're in this beautiful place
Just Call me Mr. Church
Ok, Church, what can I do for you?
In a minute.
Still waiting for one more guy.
Who?
You know him? - Yeah, we used to be on the same team together-
What's my oldest worst friend doin' here?
Both your names came to the top of the list.
Is this a problem?
Yeah, should'a shot 'em when I had a chance.
Big Barney Ross! Bigger Trent Mouzier What are you doing here?
Praying for work?
Could be
Have you been sick?
You've lost weight
Really? Well, whatever weight I lost you found, pal.
You guys aren't gonna start sucking each other's dicks, are ya?
Let's get down to business, To see who wants to work
Ever hear of an island called Valiena?
No
Yes
It's a little island in the Gulf - That's right-
You should read more
Thanks
There are resources on that island that my people are very interested in
But a general by the name of Garza has overthrown a hazardous government
That's right
My people are having a problem with this fanatic Garza
So you want Garza gone - I want him dead -
All it takes is a little army. Only an idiot would do this job
How much?
Well, like I said...
I'm busy anyway, so give this job to my friend here.
Right?
Right - That's right -
Why don't we have dinner?
Sure, when?
In a thousand years
Too soon
What's his fuckin' problem?
He wants to be governor
I gotta recon this island first
I have a contact for you on the island
Good riddance
I got the feelin' that everyone else has passed on this job, so our fee is... five million 5 million?
I want half up front, the other half in an offshore account, you got a problem with that?
No
What I have a problem with is people who try to fuck me over
So if you take this money
And you don't deliver or you try to fuck me with some kinda weird cockamamie scheme of yours
Me, and my people are gonna come get you and your people and chop you up into little fucking dog treats
You gotta problem with that?
Let's talk
Valiena - Yeah, Valiena -
They got work there?
Come on
I ain't got shit for you, Gunner
Don't replace me
I'm good
I'm still good
You're still using.
I can't trust you anymore, man
You can't trust me? - Yeah -
You can't trust me?
Be careful
You threatening me, Gunner?
No
I am a nice guy
So, going over the info this guy Church gave me, there's probably about six thousand people on the island
How many soldiers?
Perhaps a few hundred
Wouldn't take much more than that to control a space that small
Great. They got a small army
And what have we?
Four and a half men
Not so funny
I need a raise. - Why?-
I need the money for my son
I want to send him to a better school
When did Yen Yang get a family?
I have no idea - You no ask -
I no tell
Anyway...
The pay share will stay the same.
That's the way it's gonna be.
Now, the target on the island, a guy named General Garza
What's the problem? - Who gives a shit what the problem is? -
We have problems here is enough for us
That we can not get rid of them .
Totally, when's the last time you seen your analyst?
This morning - Yeah?
What you talk about? -
Avoidant Personality Disorder
You think too much - You know, Tollwell? -
You're an unusual guy.
And you're always gonna have unusual problems, right?
Unusual?
You are talking about my ear
Oh, come on, don't start with the ear again.
Not again, we all know the ear story
We all know
Let's just concentrate on the job - Hey, no.
Shit, no. You guys started this -
We all know I wrestled in college
Right
A common injury associated with that sport is trama to the ear a clot
Which, if left unattended, causes a contraction in the cartilage and forms cauliflower ears
And your point is? - It ain't easy being green -
In any case
Me and Christmas are gonna head down to Valiena and scout the island to see if we should take the job
How much pay?
I need more money for my family
What family?
My family
Listen, that girl wasn't your type
Her lost, right? - I should've broke that bastard's jaw-
Maybe if you were lucky he could've broke yours
Impossible
You know,Christmas
I understand, but
Let's just say you were with her for a couple of hours, and it's nice and it's hot and heavy
But after that, think about it...
What do you do for the rest of the day?
She probably did you a favor
You have more time to feel sorry for yourself
You are a great bastard
Good morning Good morning Good Morning - Speak English? -
Big plane, huh?
Yeah, we use it to tranport injured animals - Why are you here? -
Ornithologist
We are photographing exotic packs
You're nervous? - Nervous? -
Why? - You look nervous -
Do I look nervous?
Yeah, your skin looks a little dry, I think you should fly with the windows closed
It's the altitude
It is the altitude, it'll get to you
What is the address?
Yes, it's in my head
Wanna share it?
Canteen Gloria
Spanish
Who are you? Zoro?
Army
Come on, in there
You rollin'?
Yeah Get the suit.
Tighten up on the suit
Got it Look at these clowns, hand picked monkeys
What's wrong with this picture?
Everything
Let's get out of here
What's the point?
I mean, you think you know someone, and you truly do not.
Aren't you the guy who said "The man who can best get along with women is the man who can get along without them"?
That's bullshit
Truthfully, she wasn't your type
I wasn't finished - Look, enjoy your freedom -
Yeah, you wait 'til it happens to you - It has -
Contact's late
Alright, let's go
Chill
You ever been rejected?
You're really pushing the boundaries of our relationship, you know that?
Is that our contact?-
I'll bet she's all about it - Stay focused -
You the contact? - I'm Sandra -
What are your names?
(Buda) (Pest)
Follow me, please
Buda...Pest...nice.
You do all these?
Yes Take one
A gift - I don't take free gifts, ah... -
How much do you want for it? - Nothing taking money for something is not a gift -
Taking nothing for something is- Oh-
Is it like this all the time?
This place was a beautiful place
Then, one day, they came with money and General Garza sold his soul
And the people who fight back are killed
You said "THEY came with money".
Some Americans That's all I know
But one day all this will change
You really believe that? - Yes -
The best day will be the one when we can say our lives are our own again
Do you have family, Sandra?
My mother died when I was small And my father is gone too
Sandra, how close can you get to the palace?
The palace? Why?
I just wanna...check out the view there
There is no view
Why don't we just go there anyway, ok?
Where is my growth?
Where is your manpower?
Do you know how long it takes for a cocoa field to produce?
Of course you don't, let me tell you
We are 8 weeks behind schedule
Kick your peasants' asses, get me my product
When you talk like this to me in front of my men
It's no good
I am your lifeline.
I am the one who coordinates all this confusion
I am making you rich
And being wealthy is very good
It allows people to be the real ass-wipes nature intended them to be
Sometimes
Things are just not worth the money
Sure they are
Sandra, are we close?-
It's just over there-
Pull over please
Where are you going?
Where am I going.
Well, I suppose you could say I love to see the world from different views
Do not lose my hat
We should get goin'
He's very emotional
What are you looking for?
Sandra...
How do I know you're not setting us up?
What does "setting us up" mean?
You don't look like the kind of person we deal with all the time.
An American came here.
He asked my friend to show you around.
He was afraid, so he asked me to
And you're not afraid.
I'm afraid
But he said that maybe you can help the Valiena
I don't think so
Listen
If I were you, I'd leave
Just leave
You should leave
Do not say anything, let me speak
Run!
Get her - Got her -
Are you crazy?!
You could have killed me! - You're Welcome! -
Alright, speed it up!
We are on the way
We get out of here it's a miracle
She's coming with us, right? - She'd better -
How can we leave? - We have a plane -
No, I can not leave
Well, you don't have no choice - Yes, I do -
They'll find you in an hour - Maybe, but I'm staying -
Stay for what?
There's nothing here
Not to you
Look, you stay here, you're dead.
She's leaving with us
I got the guys inside - Give me a 60 second lead - You got it-
Go. Go. Go.
Come on
Get in
Get in! - No, no, I can not -
Let's go - I can not.
I belong here -
There is no time - Go.
You look nervous
Run! Run, you burfbag! Where is the girl? - Gone.
She won't leave -
Won't leave?
Don't know of anybody who would want to stay
I don't believe this shit
Climb, baby, climb
Goin' back?
Yeah - Ride & die -
Ride & Die, let's do it
Great job
That was a statement?
How did two, obviously professionals, pass right through security personal kill 41 soldiers and get away?
With help, that's how
Everything is under control except for one detail
A daughter
Who wants her father and company dead and gone. Bad Shakespear
Some how the Company parasites got to her.
Look, she's your daughter, and that's tragic
But blood or not, she goes
To hell with the price of lemons
You don't kill your family - Come around my house during the holidays, pal-
Nice bird
First of all, I do not feel comfortable talking business with a giant carrying a shotgun
Pretty boy wouldn't give it up
Not if you wanna know where they are
What do you know?
I was one of them
Why are you turning on them? - Personal problems -
We settled on 50 - No, math wiz -
We settled on a hundred grand, up front in my pocket
This guy thinks he's a real bad ass
This case is a bloody joke
Life is a joke, shitface!
If you don't want that Fu Man Chew knocked back into the 60s, you better keep your gum chewin' trap shut, and show some respect
Bring it
Hey!
Be nice
Need a face lift, pretty boy?
Back off, Peyton - I'm gonna kill him -
We need him
Back off!
This is what I think is happening.
This guy who calls himself Church is really a front for the ClA
So, we're working for the Agency - Yeah -
Church hired us to take out the General but the real target is this guy - James Monroe
He used to be with the Agency, but got greedy, went rogue, and teamed up with the General to keep the whole drug operation for themselves
And that's a big cash plus. But Church and the Agency can't afford to send in the Navy Seals or Special Forces to take out one of their own
That would be a bad head line, so they hire us to kill 'em
Then they're back in business
And we're taken out- Nobody's gonna miss us-
Is it still 5 million?
We'd never live to spend it. I'm telling Church the deal's off
Sound about right?
It's about right - I agree -
Where is he?
Who the hell is this?
Some punk
Do not worry about it
We got your back
If he comes over here we'll bust his ass
What do you want?
Your life
I was thinking about taking it - Is that right? -
But I don't do so well in tight spaces, so going to prison worries me
You shouldn't have bruised her face - Really? -
Would have like to have kept it the way it was
Well keep the bitch 'cause I'm done with it
I'd still like to deflate your real balls
Friend
Now you know what I do for a living
I'm not perfect, but you should have waited
I was worth it
So your daughter paints too
This is how it starts!
Let's go, there's nothing - This is all how it ends! -
What's the matter, Barney?
Don't you ever sleep? Nah.
What happened to your girlfriend?
Ha.
Another one bites the dust, brother
I was going to paint this for her and uh... you know what?
Then I'm just gonna smash the shit out of it
Want be alone?
Not really So what's up?
On the island, there was this girl
Yep, usually are
Yeah
She showed us around, she was the target's daughter
When she had a chance to leave... she didn't do it
Ump, she had some guts
Why can't I get that out of my mind?
'Cause she stands for something
That dried all up like this is gonna dry all up
It's your paint is gonna dry
What dried up?
Just belief.
Just belief in the soul. Just...
I don't know, the human parts, brother.
You remember that time we were up in Bosnia?
We took down them Serb bad boys?
All our guys were gettin' chopped up all around us and... there was blood everywhere
I never thought I was gonna make it out of there, and I know you didn't... and you didn't either - Yeah -
Kinda feelin' like...dead too, ya know?
My head's all very, very black place.
Just goddamn directly to black
I remember I got this bottle of this local shit they have over there.
And I ain't feelin' no pain now ... and I come up on this, uh...
I come up on this overland bridge, and I see this ....
I see this
I see this woman standing there, ya know? ... and she's uh...
I stepped out, and she saw me, and she's just lookin' right... right in my eyes.
And I was lookin' her right in her eyes, and...
I knew what she was going to do
She looked at me, and I knew she was gonna jump
You know what I did, man?
I just turned around and I just kept walkin'...
Until I heard that splash
And she was gone.
After... after taking all of them lives... she was one that...
I could have saved but I didn't, and uh...
What I realized later on was uh... if I'd have saved that woman...
I might have saved what was left of my soul, ya know?
A wise dead man once told me that a real man... never strikes a woman
You push some, if you have to but you never strike
It's the way I was raised
This man, however, does not share that moral dellima...no ....
This man ...well
So the question is, Sandra...
Why were the Americans here?
Again
What did the American tell you?
What are they after?
Continue
I'm going back to Valiena - Yeah?
What is the plan? - There is no plan -
We need a strategy - I'm going, and you're not -
What? - I said I'm going and you guys are not -
Are you out of your mind? - It's personal business -
You don't owe that woman nothing - Didn't say I did -
If you want to kill yourself, fine. Your call
Listen, I don't want to kill myself.
You guys take care. I gotta do this
I gotta do this
Hey, hey!- What?
Don't lay this guilt crap on us. We don't deserve it
Hey, this is my choice, there's no guilt
There's no guilt
Take care
Yeah, fuck it, his choice
Yeah... I said I'm going alone
I'm going too
Come on, Yang, get out
Just drive
Do not lose your nerve
Don't talk to me, cockroach
Why are you doing this?
Friends die together
Hey!
Give me the good luck ring. Come on
Don't make me hurt you, Yang.
Speed better than luck
Whatever...
It's difficult
What is?
My life is difficult. I need more money
Why's that?
I work harder than the rest - No you don't -
Yes I do
Because they're taller Everything's harder for me
When I get hurt, the hole is bigger
Because I'm smaller
When I travel, I need to go further - I know, because you're smaller, right? -
Yes
My life is harder than you think
I need more money
I know, you told me
For your family, right?
I don't have family
I know
Maybe one day I will
Get out there! - Why me? -
Because you're smaller
Oops
Do that again, I'll kill ya!
Gunner! Aww!
Beautiful!
That's good
What are you doin'?
You're dead, junkie!
Insects
Shit! What are you wearing?
Size 3? Bring it, Happy Feet
My turn!
Gunner! Shit!
You shot me
Don't say that.
You were gonna kill him
I was just gonna scare him
Don't put that on me, you never liked him
Am I dying?
Shot you a couple of inches above your heart
I'll take that as a "yes"
Gunner, who sent you?
Who hired you?
Who cares?
Do yourself a favor, don't let go until you cooperate for once in your miserable life
That better make me right
You got it
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
Is the girl still alive? - Come closer -
You know, it's not easy being your friend
That's true
Man, we'll die with you.
Just don't ask us to do it twice
I know the lay out.
I'll tell you about it on the way
What the hell happened to you?
It's too sad to talk about it
Let's fly
You know, the enemy will always be terrified of noise
Especially shotguns
With this big boy spittin' out 250 rounds a minute, you tell me who's tolerating that
Absolutely zero
So let me get this right:
Gunner tries to kill you, you shoot him, at death's door he gives you the whole layout?
It was something like that
I would have win - I know you would have win -
You know what?
I trust you
Want you to meet my girlfriend (Oomayah Kaboom)
You lost me there
When Oomaya's primer strikes, she gets off a reentry warhead that arms itself
And when that happens, anything that gets in my lady's way becomes instant red sauce and chowder
And if that doesn't work...
Her sister will
You should meet my doctor
Too late
It's 3:36. We have 20 minutes to take this place down. I'll take the cellar
We've got company
I've got him.
You guys take off
Is there a reason you've taken the soldiers this man has trained and made them look like fools?
They look like warriors
Warriors loyal to me
I thought the people of Valiena hired these mercenaries to kill me
But then I think, maybe this is your plan
Because you can not control me
And torturing Sandra
Works for you
You want to kill her to make me suffer
A man can never kill a child
But you can
Bring Sandra here
Bring her now
Or I will kill you
Go get her!
It's me
It's me
I won't hurt you
How are you here? I just am Can you move?
Yes Ok Time's up.
Where's Barney? - What's the call? -
If he's not come in 10 minutes, we're gonna assemble the same way we came in - No way! -
This's what he wants - Ten minutes! -
Let's go
Stop!
Don't!
No, don't kill him!
It's not his fight, it's mine! - Get here out of here! -
Seal the building
Stand him up If you didn't have this kevlar vest your insides are gonna be like fuckin' mush
Well ain't that a shame?
You know you're a lucky man
Well, I ain't feelin' lucky, man
You are a lucky man
He told me to keep you conscious
Did he? Alright.
First... you're a real tough guy, aren't you?
What? - Are you a real tough guy? -
Look at me you piece of trash
How many men you got?
Just your mother!
This is your last time
You give me the right answer I'll cut you a break
You give me the wrong answer you will die a damned slow death. Do you understand me?
Yes - Do you understand me? -
Yep- Who sent you?
Breathe, can't breathe
Loosen up
Who sent you?
Your hair dresser
GO, MAN, GO!
Come on!
Shit! Remember this shit at Christmas!
Damn, that thing's loud! - What happened to you? -
Got my ass kicked
Alright, come on!
Get my rifle, let's go!
What's this?
Everything bad that has happened you bring
Take your money!
I only see death with you.
I'm not goin' anywhere - You are done here -
You can't succeed without me
I am the leader!
You're a puppet in a hat!
Shut up! - No! -
NOW! Get back!
(Throw down your weapons!) (There's no way out!)
Shit's gettin' old!
Your lucky ring stinks
I know
Let's backtrack - Building's rigged.
Chopper's ready in 5 minutes- We're not leaving yet-
What's he saying? - He's saying we're dead with an accent -
We ain't dead
Blow the building - Not yet -
We will kill this American disease
Blow the building! - She's down there! -
The money!
Blow it! Blow it!
She's out!
Blow the fucking building!
I'm out! Let's go, come on!
Cut Monroe off!
Come on!
Hey!
It's too heavy - Give me it -
What do you want me to do?
Throw it as high as you can
Blow up the dump
Got it Monroe!!
Drop the weapons, or I'll put a bullet through her eye
Don't test me
No No - Shut up or I'lll kill you -
The Agency's parasites hired you, didn't they?
I'd have paid you twice as much... to go fishing
You have to think I'm pretty freakin' stupid to surrender to the Agency
Why would I do that?
I created this
I made it all happen
And they wanted me out.
Why? Because I saw the big picture
Stop walking
And what about me and you?
We both the same... we're both mercenaries
We're both dead inside
Why the hell did you come after me?
I didn't come after you, dipshit.
I came for her
Call it a tie
Yeah, I guess so
You're not as fast as you think
I'm beginning to sense that
Same account number as mine.
It'll help get things going around here.
No, I can't
You've done so much - Yeah, well, so have you -
Gift for a gift
You take it
Will you come back?
I promise I'll always be around
Take care, Sandra
Take care
Bye What?
Truthfully? - Yeah -
I never really thought she was your type
Come on, let's see what you've got
Ghostdiver! Ohhhh! You...go...You...go!
So, you're back from the dead
How ya healin?
Good
Considering you could have kill me
I forgive you
OK
I would have win
Of course
Hey Garner!
Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, brother. Therapy
Man's got a point
You know what?
I'm gonna do you a favor, Toole
I once knew a man called Toole
I love poetry to me was the epitome of cool
He was good with a knife
Bad with a wife
That hurts - But to think he could beat me -
Dreaming
He'd defeat me
Cool Toole You gotta be a fool

I restore old cars, so.. .
Hair-dryer.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
-This is getting to be a habit. -Yeah, it is.
Sorry about that.
-Thank you. -Yeah. -Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.
-Boston?
-Yeah.
Gate 12.
-Enjoy your flight, Mr. Garcia. -Thank you.
Hi.
I'm sorry. You're not on this flight.
Well, I just checked in for this one, like, 10 minutes ago.
That must be some sort of mistake.
I'm sorry, the computer shows that we're booked.
Listen, Sharry.
Tomorrow my little sister's getting married.
I practically raised her.
I'm sorry, we are completely sold out.
Listen, can you help me out for a second? She's my little sister.
She's April, I'm June, she's counting on me to march her down the aisle tomorrow.
That's very sweet, but the 1 1 :50 will get you there tomorrow morning with plenty of time.
Your boarding pass, sir?
Sometimes things happen for a reason.
-Enjoy your flight, Mr. Miller.
-Thank you. This is the final boarding call for US Midland Air, flight 77 non-stop service to Boston's Logan Airport, now boarding at gate 12. Would all passengers holding a valid boarding pass, please proceed...
I should've seen it coming, boss.
He went on tilt, he came undone.
Coming undone in our business means you need a margarita.
It doesn't mean capping a dozen people in a government lab and blowing it up.
It doesn't mean stealing an object of critical importance. -Does he have the Zephyr or not? -We believe so.
You believe so.
-Check it out.
-I don't care what you believe, Fitz. -I need you to clean your mess up. -Go back and play it again.
We'll have it in hand by the time he lands in Boston.
Find out who and what she is.
Should I have the field office pick her up in Wichita?
I got a better idea. Miss Havens?
We did find a seat for you.
I'd like to have your attention, please.
We apologize for the delay. We will be departing Wichita Airport shortly.
Thanks for your patience.
I know it's policy or whatever and it's just your job, -but it's kind of lame. -Again, I apologize.
Fitz. What did you do?
It's no wonder these airlines are going out of business.
We have been cleared onto the runway.
There's nobody on the plane.
The captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign.
Please remain seated until the sign has been turned off and it's safe to move about the cabin.
I'm June, by the way.
I'm Roy Miller.
-Nice to meet you. -It's very nice to meet you. Tequila on the rocks?
Yeah. Just in time, thanks.
So, your sister's getting married tomorrow? -Excuse me?
-Your sister.
She's getting married tomorrow. Congratulations.
Yeah, thanks.
You know, Roy, I'm a bad liar.
I'm sorry, how's that?
April is getting married, but not till Saturday.
You had me fooled.
Well, I do have a fitting tomorrow.
So, I do, actually, have to go home.
I hope this isn't gonna be a rough flight.
It might be.
Wichita is a long way to go for a carburetor.
It's not just any carburetor.
It's a triple deuce.
I'm restoring a '66 GTO.
And Kansas has the best scrap.
Really?
My dad had a garage, and when I was a kid, he bought this chassis.
He used to take us to yards, and search for parts, you know?
He died in '98, and now that April's getting married, I just figured, why not finish it up, give it to her sort of as a wedding present?
Kind of like a present from our dad, too, you know?
That's nice.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
I used to think that someday, when the last part went in,
I would just climb into that GTO and start it up.
Just drive and drive and drive, and just keep driving until I got to the tip of South America.
-Cape Horn.
-Yeah.
-There's beautiful islands down there.
-Yeah?
Pirate islands.
Yeah, "someday."
That's a dangerous word. Dangerous?
It's really just code for "never."
I think a lot about things I haven't done.
Dive in the Great Barrier Reef. Ride the Orient Express.
Live on the Amalfi Coast with nothing but a motorcycle and a backpack.
Kiss a stranger on the balcony of the Hotel Du Cap.
Where is that?
South of France.
What about you?
What's your list?
Well, yours sounds pretty good.
Wow. Thanks.
It's no problem.
I'll just put this up here, if that's all right.
You know what?
I'm gonna go back and use the restroom.
-I'll help you.
-Thanks.
Lots of turbulence, huh?
-I'll be out in a minute.
"Kiss a stranger on the balcony of the Hotel Du Cap"?
I mean, what kind of a line is that?
I mean, it's, like, a really good line.
Ma'am? Ma'am? Did you see his hands, by any chance?
They just, like, snatched that bag right out of the air.
Lightning-fast reflexes.
Not cool.
Okay. This will help.
Enough.
It's over, Roy.
Yeah, I agree.
Enough.
Where's the Zephyr?
Why is the girl on the plane?
Tell me.
Why did Fitz put her on the plane? Don't move, Miller.
So what are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do? You're just gonna let this opportunity pass you by?
No, of course you're not. You're gonna walk right through that door, you're gonna get it right. It's not your first rodeo, woman.
Hey. I decided to join you.
I'm sorry. l.. .
-No, no, don't.. .
It's great.
-I'm sorry. It's just, like, the tequila and the altitude and everything.
There's something I've gotta tell you.
What? Oh, my God, you're in a relationship.
I'm so sorry.
No, no, no.
That's not it.
Okay, I'm all ears.
What is it?
Are we landing?
No, not yet.
No?
Listen, there's no need to panic.
I have contained the situation.
Situation?
Yeah.
We've lost the pilots.
-Where did they go?
-I mean, they're dead.
-The pilots are dead.
-Shot. It's.. .
Shot?
By who?
Well, me.
Actually, I shot the first pilot.
He shot the second pilot accidentally.
It's just one of those things.
Seriously, this is great!
Really, I'm relieved you are taking this so well.
Where are you going?
I'm just gonna go check on things and think about landing.
Would you mind putting your seatbelt on for me? -That would be great. -Yeah.
This is weird.
Mayday. Mayday.
This is US Midland Air 77 heavy. What's happening?
Everybody's dead out there!
Come on in.
Sit down.
Mayday, mayday, mayday. -Everybody's dead in here.
-I'm declaring an emergency.
-Oh, my God!
Are we going down? -I'm sorry?
Are we going down?
No, June, it's just a rapid descent. Please, sit down.
Please state your emergency, Midland 77.
I'm sorry, I think I've heard enough of this guy.
Are you a pilot? Who are you?
The shoulder straps.
You can put those over, and it clicks in right down there.
You wanna click it right there, that's it.
Okay, I got it, I got it. Okay.. . Gear down, showdown.
Why can't we just land in an airport?
No, no, that wouldn't be a good idea.
-They'll be waiting for us.
-What do you mean? Waiting for us? -Who?
-I think the less you know, the better.
What?
Okay, we're gonna touch down here. Oh, God. Oh, my God!
-That's a truck. That's a truck!
-Yeah. -That's a truck!
-Yup. That's a truck!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! -That's a curve.
That's a curve! -I see it.
I see it. Oh, my God! Oh, God!
Okay, this is good.
What's good?
Take a sip of that.
It'll take the edge off.
-Are you shot?
-Yeah, how about that?
It's just a scrape.
That's good news.
June, we have to discuss what's gonna happen next.
You need to go to the hospital.
Prison, maybe?
Some people are gonna come looking for you now.
Bad people. You know, I feel a little weird.
Yeah, that'll pass once you fall asleep, which should be in a couple of minutes.
-What?
-I need you to listen, June.
Did you drug me?
Yes.
-You drugged me.
-Yeah, it's for your own good.
Now, look. These bad people who are going to come and see you, they're gonna ask you about me. Okay?
And you need to tell them you don't know me. -June?
June? -Okay.
You need to tell them you don't remember anything.
And you need to avoid getting in any vehicle with them at all costs.
Okay, who are "them"?
Well, they're serious people, June.
They'll probably identify themselves as federal agents, and they'll DlP you.
Dip me? ln what?
Dis-lnformation Protocol.
They'll tell you a story about me.
About how I'm mentally unstable, paranoid.
How I'm violent and dangerous, and it'll all sound very convincing.
I'm already convinced.
There's a few common DlP keywords to listen for.
Reassuring words. Words like, "stabilize," "secure," "safe." lf they say these words, particularly with repetition.. .
Okay. ...it means they're going to kill you.
Oh, God!
Or intern you somewhere offshore for a very long time. -Okay? -Okay.
Now, stay with me. lf they tell you you're safe.. .
lf they tell me I'm safe, they're gonna kill me.
-Don't get in what?
-Vehicles.
-Any vehicles.
-Okay, any vehicles. -Just run.
-I'll run.
-Run.
-Run.
And if they ask you about me.. . I don't know you.
I don't know you at all.
Who are you, Roy?
...a mixing of rain and snow, good for ski country, but probably... -Thanks, Andrea.
-You're welcome. Now, back to our top news story of the morning.
Here's Bradley Moss, with an on-the-scene report. According to FAA sources, at approximately 7.:30 last night, all contact was lost with a Boston-bound commuter jet from Wichita.
The plane was apparently passing through an area of turbulence and may have met up with wind shear or a lightning storm causing an electrical failure.
Now, this is all conjecture at this point, as all that's left is a crater in an lndiana cornfield.
Coming!
Rodney?
Thank God.
I wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah, why?
You were on that flight from Kansas, right?
-Yeah.
-I saw on the news about the crash.
What news? What crash?
-Anyway, you're alive.
-I'm alive, yeah.
Sure, that's cool.
Hey, but, June, you know.. .
I told myself that if I found you alive, that I was gonna ask you to dinner.
How about I call you later, okay?
It's just another day. It's just a normal day. Okay.
She's moving.
Wow!
And gotta love the boots.
Yeah, you know.
I promise I'll wear heels on the day.
-Hey. Can I talk to you for a second? -Yeah.
So, this weekend, I was thinking about Dad's GTO.
-Really?
-Yeah, it's just sitting there.
And I was wondering how you would feel about maybe selling it.
You wanna sell Dad's GTO?
Ben and I, we really want our own place.
Excuse me?
Anyone here belong to that blue truck parked outside?
-Yeah, why?
-You're about to get a ticket.
-Thought I put enough quarters in there.
-Yeah.
I hate getting tickets.
Excuse me.
Please step inside, miss.
Let me just go grab a few things.
Miss Havens, good afternoon.
Special Agent-in-Charge, Fitzgerald.
Will you join us inside the car for a moment?
We know you were on the flight with him last night.
The one that crashed.
Who are you again?
FBl.
You do know Mr. Miller.
No, I don't.
Well, we chatted a little bit before security, but.. .
I see.
And once you were on the flight, what happened then? More chatting?
-ls this funny to you?
-No.
He's dangerous, Miss Havens, and out of control.
He said that you'd say he was crazy.
So, you did talk to him. And about me, no less.
No.
No, not you, specifically.
About whom, then?
Simon Feck?
I don't know who that is.
Look, this is getting really twisted around, and I think I should probably call a lawyer.
We're gonna take you to a secure location, Miss Havens, until Miller is contained.
Someplace safe.
-With you? -Yes, ma'am.
You wanna tell me where we're going?
-Fellas? -Don't worry, miss, you're safe.
Excuse me?
You're safe with us.
I wanna know where we're going.
Just a shortcut till the situation is stabilized.
We'll keep you safe.
You said that already.
Because I meant it.
What is Jackson doing?
Shooter! Shooter!
Evade! Evade! Shooter on the freeway.
The dot's on your back!
Follow me, now!
Are you insane? I'm not going out that door!
Oh, my God! Get your foot off.. . -Oh, my God!
-Hey, June! -I can't see!
-You are doing great.
-I can't see!
Get out of the way!
-Open the door. -I can't get his foot off the gas.
-Open the door, June.
Open the door, June.
That's a beautiful dress, by the way.
One second.
Oh, my God! I totally know what you're talking about. It's so boring, I can't even stand it.
Totally. Thank you.
Who are you?
Oh, God!
What are you doing?
-Hi, June.
-Move out of the way, I can't see!
Please unlock the door, June.
Unlock the door.
That way, I can help you. -I can't let go!
-You need to let go, June.
-June, door!
-Got it! Just pull over!
Oh, my God!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Yup, come over here. Right over here.
Just stay down, you're doing good.
Here, hold this.
Well, well, well.
Check this out.
Nice.
These guys are loaded for bear.
You're doing well, June.
Excellent driving.
Over a dead guy, no less. You're a natural. That's a beautiful dress.
ls that for April's wedding?
-Saturday?
-Yeah. -Yeah, that will be nice.
-Yeah.
Please, stop shooting people, okay?
-Just stop shooting people.
-I understand.
You're in shock.
How about you stay here while I go have a word with the guys in the tunnel.
-Okay?
-Okay.
-Okay? -Okay.
Actually, I'm just gonna go shoot them. I'll be right back. By the way, your timing when you opened that door.. .
-Okay. -.. was sublime.
You saved us, I hope you know that. -You saved us.
-Okay.
Hey! Hey! Oh, shoot.
Hey, wait!
Wait!
Wait! Wait!
Oh, no. Excuse me, sorry. There you are.
June?
June? -Rodney?
-He's in the gym. Over there. -Hey!
-Hey! What are you doing here?
Whoa !
That's a.. .
Hey, guys, say hello to June.
-That's a dress.
-Thanks.
-Everything all right?
-Yeah.
No, it's.. .
It's complicated.
You know what?
I've been feeling the same way.
You wanna talk?
Maybe over some pie?
My point is.. .
My point is, that plane crash made me think about our break-up.
You know, this bulb went off, bing!
"Rodney, why are you giving up? You're being passive."
"Getting back at her because she didn't want the ring."
"So June didn't want to be engaged right now, "and that freaks your mom out.
Big deal!
"What about all the things you and June wanted to do together, huh?" Our list, you know?
Like camping in Vermont with my brother and Sheila in their new Winnie.
Tickets to Blue Man Group, the battlegrounds tour.
I wanna talk about the plane crash.
Okay?
Sure, what about it?
I mean, in it. I mean, I was in it.
So you were in the plane crash?
I wasn't supposed to be on that plane, but I was on it, and there was this guy who was some sort of secret agent or something, and he.. .
He killed everybody on board.
And then he landed the plane.
Next thing you know, I wake up, I'm in my room.
I have no idea how I got there.
He must've drugged me or something.
Then I go to April's fitting, because I have to wear this ridiculous dress.
These other guys, these other agents come, they snatch me up.
Next thing you know, I'm in Grand Theft Auto on the l-93.
-Why are you touching my hand?
-Because I'm here for you.
-Jeez, you are so stressed out! -Well, yeah!
-And I get it. -Really?
I completely understand. I mean.. . -Wow, June.
-I know.
-Your little sister's getting married.. .
-It's like.. . -.. and that is stressful.
-What are you talking about, Rodney? You didn't even listen to what I was talking about.
No, I did.
Look, I would probably be the same way in that situation.
What can I do to help? Setting up? We can bring the guys over.. .
No, no, no. Okay. Oh, Christ.
Hi, June.
Look, l.. .
I'm sorry if I'm interrupting anything, but.. . I'm Roy Miller.
Rodney Burris.
Rodney, hi.
How are you?
We're running out of time, and maybe I didn't make it clear enough, but we're gonna have to stick together for a little bit, because of our.. .
You know, our situation.
ln case you didn't notice, Rodney is a fireman, okay?
So he's perfectly capable of handling any situation that comes up.
Thank you very much, you can leave us alone.
I have no doubt.
Ever since I was a little kid, I have great respect for firemen. -I appreciate it.
-Fact of the matter is,
-I don't think you guys get paid enough.
-Yeah, we don't.
You're in Engine 10. Yeah, Engine 10.
Yeah.
Have you taken your lieutenant's exam yet?
-I'm working on it. -Yeah?
How's that going?
It's a bitch.
Did you ever do a tour in that hall, what is it?
Grove Hall, that's where the action is.
It's the fastest way up the ladder.
-Rodney!
-House of Flames!
I often thought l.. .
I should have been a fireman.
Rodney, this is the guy.
What? -This is the guy.
-What?
"This is the guy"?
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm the guy? -I'm the guy.
This is the guy.
-This is the guy. -This is the guy.
-I'm a guy. -I'm the guy.
-You are a guy.
-I'm a guy.
-He's the guy! He's the guy!
-Rodney, whatever happens.. .
-Please, for your own safety.. . -Rodney, whatever happens, -you should know.. . -.. .please stay in the booth.
What are you talking about? Wait!
Everybody!
Everybody get down.
Get down, down, down!
Everybody down.
Rodney, get down, or I will blow her head off.
I'll blow her head off. What did I say?
Rodney, what did I say?
-Just calm down, buddy.
-Answer!
Sorry, I thought you were making a move.
Sorry.
It's all right, I thought he was making a move.
Making a little pie.
Pies for everybody. Everybody.
Everybody gets pies, okay?
No ice-cream, à la mode. Weakens the legs, people. Lincoln knew it.
No one follows us, or I kill myself and then her.
-Get in the car.
Please.
-No.
Watch your head.
We're at 560 Harris. They're getting into a blue Volvo.
-Rodney! Rodney! -Rodney?
Oh, my God!
Rodney!
It's okay.
Look at me.
-Okay.
Look at me, it's okay.
-Shit! I shot you through and through.
No bone, nowhere near the femoral artery, okay?
All right?
This is gonna be better for you than Grove Hall.
It's all good. Okay?
You good?
-Good? -Good.
Good?
There were four security cameras in that restaurant, June.
Now there is proof you're my hostage.
So we've cleared your name, with the locals, at least.
You know? It's a start. Something to build on.
-You shot Rodney!
-Yeah, I did.
But I asked him to stay in the booth.
You shot Rodney!
It might be the best thing that ever happened to him.
Yeah, right, because we all should get shot every now and then!
Rodney.. . Rodney is a good guy, June.
But not really right for you.
I mean, you know, in my opinion.
But a good guy. Took a bullet, he's gonna be a hero.
Probably get a promotion.
-Stop the car.
Stop the car.
-What? Stop the car. Stop the car.
Stop the car.
Just stop the car!
June, I understand you want off the carousel.
I do, I wanna get off the carousel.
Please, Roy. Can you stop the car, please? Right now!
I'm not one of those "I told you so" kind of guys, but I did warn you to stay off the plane last night.
When?
Well, when I said, "Sometimes things happen for a reason."
That's not a warning.
That's not a warning, Roy!
That's like a needlepoint expression or a bumper sticker.
Next time, try, "June, if you get on this plane, you will fucking die! "
You know, Roy, maybe they meant it when they said that I would be safe.
-You really mean that, June?
-Yeah!
-Did you feel safe with them?
-Safer than I do now!
Okay, okay.
All right. Just so you understand, right now, out there, on your own, your life expectancy is like here.
With me, it's here.
Without me, here.
With me, without me.
With me, without me.
So.. . I wouldn't advise going home. But, you know, it's up to you.
So right now I need another car, keep moving.
Someone else is depending on me.
Someone whose life is in danger. Someone who trusts me. Every second I waste chasing you,
I'm letting him down.
Rodney, why did you make this brave call to leap into action?
Well, I didn't think. I just did what any man would do in that situation, you know?
-I leapt into action. -Thanks. -Like you said, it's really the job.
It really didn't even hurt. It was kind of like a bee sting. What a brave firefighter.
The doctors tell me Rodney is going to be okay, just a flesh wound.
A true blue Boston hero.
Back to you, Don. This is what it's all about.
That, right there, is what everybody wants.
A Burger King toy?
Open it up.
It's warm.
What is it? A battery.
A battery?
It's code-named Zephyr.
Not your average Duracell.
It's high output.
Never runs out.
What do you mean, "never"?
That little thing there is the first perpetual energy source since the sun.
So, what, your flashlight never runs out of juice?
It can power a lot more than a flashlight, June. Really?
How much more?
Small city.
Large submarine.
It's big.
The guy who invented it is barely out of high school.
Simon Feck.
I was assigned with another agent to watch him at a facility, a lab in Wichita.
And the other guy, the agent, is the guy who picked you up this morning.
Fitzgerald.
A couple of weeks ago, I found out he was going to sell the battery and kill Simon.
So I got Simon out of there, put him someplace safe and went back for the battery.
And Fitz set me up. Made it look like I went rogue.
That's when I met you.
So.. .
So, what's next?
I mean, what's the plan?
I think we get some rest, pick up Simon, and get you back for your sister's wedding.
I'm pretty good at what I do, June.
And tonight, we're safe.
Scout's honor.
Safe and secure?
Good night, Roy.
Were you really a Boy Scout?
Eagle Scout.
I was a Brownie.
That's cool.
Good night, Roy.
Pies for everybody. Everybody. Everybody gets pies, okay?
So, what do you think?
Are we looking at another player?
We're looking at a pawn.
I talked to her, so did he.
She owns a garage, no passport, gone nowhere, been nowhere.
She's a nobody.
You've been two steps behind since this began, Fitz.
Are you sure someone is not taking you to school?
Clean this shit up.
This is a safe-house?
Simon!
Simon?
Stay close.
Hey, Simon, this is no time to play.
What is all this?
Simon.
It's what he does.
I'm late, and he's gone.
Simon.
"Made in Austria."
Who are these people?
Are they Fitzgerald's guys?
No, it's other guys.
Other bad guys? Worse guys.
Hold my mags.
Worse guys?
Now, I need you to listen carefully.
Do exactly as I say.
On three, I'm gonna lay down cover, then we're gonna run to those shelves over there.
-Okay? -Yeah. -You ready?
-Yeah.
One.. .
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
I panicked.
-What number would you like?
-Let's just stick with three, it's good.
Okay.
One.. .
Two.. .
Three.
These guys are fancy.
Mags.
Could be Antonio Quintana's men.
He's a Spanish arms dealer.
He also wants the battery.
Ready?
-Let's move.
-Okay. June.
June!
How the hell are we gonna get out of here?
And where the hell is Simon?
I don't know yet, but he left a message.
-A message?
-Wait.
What I need you to do right now is wait here.
-Yeah.
I'm gonna find us a way out. -I can't wait here!
-I'll be right back. Wait! Roy!
Just take this.
Roy?
Shit. June?
June! June!
June!
June! June!
June!
June! June! June!
Please stop saying my name.
You keep saying my name, it's freaking me out. -Okay.
I understand.
-Okay. -Drink this.
-What is it?
Brotine-zero. They're gonna smoke us with D-5. Oh, yeah.
Where's yours?
Oh, shit.
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, no.
They're coming.
June.
I know this looks bad, but we'll be out of here in a couple of minutes.
I got this.
We gotta go, June.
Here, I'll help you. We've been hit!
But it's okay!
We get through this, we're home free!
Ready, set, go!
We're almost there.
Hey, there, sleepy head.
How long have I been out?
Eighteen hours.
Where am l?
My place.
We're off-grid.
No one's ever found me here.
Shame we can't stay longer.
We got a rendezvous with Simon.
He's fine.
I figured out his code.
He's crazy about trains.
He used the passport I gave him and went to Austria.
You drugged me again, Roy. Yeah.
You can't do that.
Well, you weren't coping well.
I'm not sure, if you were awake, if they would've even let you live.
What am I wearing?
A bikini.
We're in the tropics.
How did I get in the bikini?
June, I've been trained to dismantle a bomb in the pitch black with nothing but a safety pin and a Junior Mint.
I think I can get you in and out of some clothes without
looking. I'm not saying that's what I did, but.. .
Okay.
Sorry.
Reflex.
I deserved that.
Hit me again. I won't stop you. June.
June?
June!
...paper clips and Junior Mints.. .
"Not that I'm saying that's what I did."
Shit! ls this his phone?
Movement alert.
Amapola.
That's a '67 Grand Prix.
I thought we were off the grid.
April.
April?
April! I know! No, I'm okay!
Listen, April.. . April?
April?
April, can you hear me?
April!
April, can you.. .
I know! No, I'm okay! Listen, April...
April, can you hear me? April!
We don't know, Antonio.
We traced her phone to the Azores.
We're in range now.
Get to them before the agency. Perfect timing.
Lunch is ready.
You must be thirsty.
It's coconut.
It's loaded with electrolytes.
Just.. .
Whoa. Okay? Okay.
Just.. . Whoa.
Yeah?
Yeah!
Hey. You got skills.
-My dad wanted boys.
-Yeah?
-Let me go.
-You can get out anytime you want. I'll show you.
Hands like Houdini.
Turn your palms down, and all at once, throw your hands to the ground and your hips back.
Nice.
That was good.
Who are you?
Really.
I don't understand.
Follow me. I don't understand.
I came in clean.
My phone is secure. It's secure.
Unless you made a call.
-And you didn't make a call. -No, I didn't make a call.
I took a call.
You took a call?
It was a quick one.
You.. .
Come on.
I thought we were off the grid, -and then the phone rang. -It's okay.
It was my sister and I had to take the call. -You know? I didn't want her to worry.
No, no, no.. .
I can't get into that. I just can't get into that thing.
I can't get into that.
-June. -Roy.. .
Just, please, knock me out.
Use broton-seven or whatever.
-It's okay.
-You're grabbing my neck.
You asked me not to drug you.
Okay, good.
Hands like Houdini. Hands.. . Roy?
-I can't feel my face!
-Okay, time.
Okay, Simon.. . Roy, the pull on this thing.. .
-We said 10 minutes. -The traction on this thing. -It can pull up to 50,000 metric tons!
-I get it. It's a diesel hydraulic!
Don't you wanna see your Zephyr?
Yes.
-Excuse me.
-Guten Morgen, miss.
Can you tell me where we are?
Right now, miss? We are in Austria.
Austria, huh?
Would you like some breakfast, miss?
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.
Okay, I'm gonna have some pancakes, scrambled eggs.. .
-Scrambled eggs. -.. and.. . With a glass of milk.
And a glass of milk.
-Can I get a Harvey Wallbanger, please? -Certainly, sir.
You know, statistically, you're a lot more likely to die riding on a train than any other form of transportation.
10.3 times more likely than dying on a plane.
Simon?
Simon Feck?
Yes.
My name is June. I'm a friend of Roy Miller's.
Have you found him yet?
Have you seen him?
No, not yet.
-Don't you wanna answer that?
-Yeah. But I can't.
I'm not supposed to.
It might be Roy.
Yeah, but he told me not to answer the phone, because the signal can be tracked.
That's right. Of course.
Did Roy happen to tell you about the plan here?
Are we supposed to meet him here, or.. .
What did you say that drink was? -A Harvey.. .
-It's a Harvey Wallbanger.
Do you mind just ordering me one of those?
Because it looks great. I'll just be right back.
You just stay here for a second.
I'll be right back.
Something is wrong.
It's getting hotter, Roy.
She didn't answer her phone.
-I told her not to. That's.. . -We just got here.
-That's good news.
-I'm sure she'll turn up.
Roy.. . -I left a note posted right there.
-We may have an issue here.
-The temperature.. . -She's hungry.. .
She's hungry.
It's getting too hot.
We need to cool it down.
Yeah, she went to get something to eat.
Come on, Simon.
-May I help you?
-Yeah.
I'm feeling a little bit train-sick. ls it okay if I hang out here for a while?
Of course, I will get you some water.
Here you go.
Antonio Quintana wants to know where is the battery?
Where is the battery?
I'm sorry, I'm looking for ice.
-Roy.
-Bernhard.
Miller.
-Wrong room.
-It's okay. It's okay. -You know him?
-Yeah. He's an assassin, platinum grade. He's come to collect Simon.
Oh, my God.
-And to kill you. -That's Simon?
-Yeah, June, Simon.
Simon, June. -Hi.
Jeez!
I'm okay.
I got this.
Simon, please move.
You have quite some balls, Fraulein.
Hands like Houdini.
I'm so sorry.
But you were trying to kill me.
That's disgusting.
Oh, my God.
Just die!
Oh, shit.
I got to get you guys someplace safe.
-They're not on the train.
-Oh, really?
Cameras at the last station show nothing.
They must have gotten off between stops.
Locals haven't found anything.
Always the classics, Roy.
Salzburg, Austria. Very nice.
Yes. No, we just got in. Well, we're talking now.
It's a beautiful city, huh?
Yeah.
Never seen anything quite like it.
Neither have l.
I got to go out for a bit.
Okay.
I was thinking about ordering some room service.
And I thought maybe we could have dinner or something.
That sounds great.
9:00?
9:00 sounds great.
June?
Could you do me a favor and just stick around here?
It's better.
Oh, yeah, of course.
Where else am I gonna go?
See you in a bit.
They're not gonna hurt you.
You're too valuable to them. Now, just breathe, listen to your music.
Here, as a matter of fact, I got that for you.
I know you like them.
Cool, thanks.
Listen, order as much room service as you like, but don't leave the room.
Okay.
-We need to talk about the Zephyr later.
-And we will.
You seem different.
Do l?
So, who's your companion?
She's beautiful.
The blonde.
She seems capable.
I just met her.
She's a nobody.
Just someone I picked up along the way.
That's a shame.
This is getting boring.
Are we gonna do a deal or not?
Don't speak to me like that.
I will speak to you any way I please, Tony.
We both know you're lucky I'm here. I have the battery.
I'm on a schedule.
The world is full of bad guys and people are calling.
I understand.
What's your price?
I have a figure in mind.
What's it worth to you?
Are you angry about your island, Roy?
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, Tony.
I'm lsabel George, Director of Counter Espionage at the ClA.
I'm sure you are.
Forgive me, I just.. .
I just don't know exactly what to believe.
Well, that's understandable, considering that the last five days you've been fed a steady diet of misinformation and fantasy by an agent of ours who's recently gone rogue.
Well, he said that Fitzgerald was the one that wanted to steal the battery.
Well, let's examine the facts.
Miller told you that he was protecting the Zephyr from people wanting to misuse it.
But now he's trying to sell it to an international arms dealer.
Antonio Quintana.
One of Europe's leading weapons manufacturers.
Ask yourself, Miss Havens, has Roy Miller said anything to you that's proven to be true?
-God, excuse me. -No, I'm sorry. Sorry, I was looking at my phone.
He used you as a mule to carry the battery through security, Miss Havens.
He's been playing you.
He's a spy, that's what he does.
He lies for a living.
Any love, empathy, we train that right out of them.
What did you imagine?
The two of you would move into a condo together, get a dog?
You can't have a life with him. That's fantasy.
But you can have yours back.
She's been gone eight minutes.
We need you to get back to the hotel before Miller. -What am I supposed to do?
-All right, then.
This pen is a transmitter.
Once you have confirmation that Miller has not hidden the Zephyr, that it's somewhere nearby, or on his person, you can confirm this by simply clicking the top button.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Everything go okay?
Well enough.
It's getting hotter.
So, did you get your price?
I followed you tonight.
You have nothing to say?
Here's to Wichita where we first.. .
Bumped into each other.
Do you think that was fate, Roy?
I don't believe in fate.
But I believe in luck.
I don't know what to believe.
That hurt more than I thought it would.
I'm going home.
They promised that if you turned yourself in, they'd protect you.
I love your optimism.
Never lose it.
Get her out of here. He's not here, sir.
Did they tell you you're going home?
You've seen the inside of the honeycomb, June!
You can't go home.
The suspect is on the roof. Oh, shit. Director George!
Get her in the car.
He's heading toward the river. Stand down!
He has the battery!
Hey! Hey! Hold it!
Hold your fire!
Stand down! He has the battery! Did you secure the kid?
Yeah.
Did they find Roy?
We'll find the body.
We have to.
He went down with the Zephyr.
Thank you, guys. Fitz?
Fitz, I think we just made a wrong turn.
Ramstein is that way, west.
I think we're going south.
You know what?
You're right. Tell him we're back on track.
I don't have the battery, but no one's gonna get it now.
Yeah, I've got the next best thing.
I'll see you in Spain in two days.
Hey, Wilmer.
-How was the party?
-It was nice.
-I see the goat is still out there.
-Yeah.
I thought it was a wedding present.
It was, but,
I think I wanted her to want it more than she wanted it.
Okay. ...Boston's classic rock station. Here are the Kingsmen.
This just come in?
G-body Grand Prix. Longest hood in history.
Gonna be a real beaut.
Ru-pa.. . Fee-pa.. .
No, it's.. .
5826 Amapola.
That's like an hour from here.
Maybe it's a safe-house.
Here we go. Shit!
Who's out there?
I'm not afraid to use this.
Oh, Frank, look at her!
I want to know what she's doing on my lawn in the middle of the night. l.. .
I have the pistons you ordered.
Pistons?
For the '67 Grand Prix.
Molly, I didn't.. . You are all wet.
Please, come inside.
That Pontiac you have out there, Frank, is a real classic.
I really love pre-'70s Grand Prixs.
So, you two lived here long?
This old place? It's been our home for 40 years.
Sit down, honey.
Have a cookie.
Frank thinks we should move, but you know what?
And we can afford to stay, thanks to Publishers Clearing House. You won Publishers Clearing House?
-Twice.
-Plus, we won two lotto quick picks
-Frank doesn't even remember buying.
-Because I didn't buy them.
Oh, yeah, like you didn't order pistons off the lnternet.
You don't know what you're typing into that computer, Frank.
Another couple of minutes on your clothes, honey. So,
Roy Miller.
This was one of his safe-houses, wasn't it? What in the hell are you talking about?
Honey, what's this all about?
I'm sorry, I just thought, maybe.. .
I must've had this all wrong.
I was just looking for some information about my friend, Roy.
lf you'd like to change, there's a powder room right there.
That's our son, Matthew.
We lost him in Kuwait. There was a chopper crash.
He saved the lives of two of his crewmen, and.. .
He just always took care of everyone.
He was an Eagle Scout. This was taken the day he got that swimming badge.
He could swim clear across Lake Sunapee with practically one breath.
I just.. .
I've been terribly rude.
I'm June Havens.
Molly Knight.
This is June Havens, and I'm leaving a message on my own machine for whoever is listening to this phone call.
I have the Zephyr.
I have the Zephyr, and I'm ready to make a deal.
I'm sitting on Route 28, right outside New Hampshire.
And if you want the Zephyr, you better come and get it.
Hey, fellas.
So, you want the Zephyr?
I got the Zephyr.
It's right here. Come and get it.
Come on.
Let's go!
Welcome to España.
Today is the festival of San Fermin.
Have you ever seen a bullfight, Miss Havens?
My name is Antonio Quintana.
I know who you are.
What did he give me?
It's something we're developing at my company.
A new kind of truth serum.
Really?
I have a few questions for you about the battery, since we both know what you gave to my men was a joke.
I don't like you very much.
The truth!
Good!
You know, I really like Miller, though.
'Cause, you know, I was totally wrong about him in Salzburg.
He wanted me to hear that phone call so that I would follow him.
I'd turn him in, and then he could get me home safely.
He was trying to protect me. Shut up.
It's crazy that I could feel so powerful and capable around him.. .
-Shut up. -.. and yet he takes care of me.
Shut up!
Where is the battery?
Where is it?
I bet you've never made a girl an omelet, have you, Antonio?
Don't test me, June.
Or got her to her sister's wedding on time.
It's really the little things, honestly.
-But they count so much.
-Enough!
Okay!
Miller is dead!
Roy Miller is dead, he's out.
No.
No, he's not. He can hold his breath for a really long time.
He is dead!
I'm not gonna ask you again.
But if you don't tell me what I need to know, -you're gonna die!
-I don't know where the battery is.
Then why did you tell everyone you had it? Why?
Because I was trying to find Roy.
Well, Antonio, whenever there's bad guys like you around, Roy's not too far away.
You're gonna die.
Finally!
Nice to meet you, John.
Antonio.
Too bad you couldn't get the battery. Where is the boy?
You didn't think I'd just bring the package, did you? Come on.
Why don't you follow me down to the river and bring the money?
Okay.
ls this thatching in here? Because I've never seen anything like that before. We have really old architecture in Boston, but nothing like this.
My thoughts are so clear.
ls this all weapons money, or is this family money?
Gardens!
He likes gardens, huh?
Do you guys ever do any gardening? It's really relaxing. It's amazing how much you can just.. .
This really is a happy place.
Look at these trumpet flowers.
They.. . Okay, Eduardo, you don't have to pull me around. You can just tell me where you want me to go, okay?
-This way, blondie. -See?
Now we're communicating.
I bet you're taking me someplace safe and secure.
Someplace special.
Antonio's special place.
Antonio has a special place? That's so nice.
Everyone should have a special place.
-Luis?
-ls there a problem, Eduardo?
-Hi, Roy.
-Hi, June.
You're supposed to be home.
-You're supposed to be dead.
-I can explain.
-You don't have to.
-I came here to get Simon. -I just, you know, caught up with him. -That's cool.
His name is Eduardo.
Eduardo.
I need you to listen, because when you wake up, you're gonna call your boss and you're gonna tell him that Roy Miller, that's me, has the battery and escaped with the girl.
-You have the battery?
-Yeah.
You tell him I'm coming for him.
-Yes.
-Okay. Let's go.
I'm worried about Simon.
I haven't seen him.
My tracker has been spotty.
Life with you is so exciting.
You excite me, Miller.
I took too long to get here.
-7:00.
-What?
7:00.
I think I feel like having sex.
I think we'd have really great sex.
Did they give you something?
You should hydrate.
Roy?
Roy.
Roy?
June. June?
You don't seem very happy to see me, Roy.
What?
Not really.
I am happy.
-So the red dot is us?
-No, we're yellow.
The red dot is Simon. Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
-Air time.
-Air time?
He says his name is Roy Miller.
He says he has the battery.
Miller is here.
There he is!
There he is!
This way. Follow me!
Bulls?
-There's Fitz! -I see him. -Take the guns.
-Okay. Here.
-What next?
-Let them have it.
June Havens, you've got skills.
Let's go!
Go. -See you down there.
-Are you sure?
No.
Sorry. -Get up. -Okay.
Freeze right there, Roy!
Hey, Simon.
Get down on your knees, now!
-Roy!
-Now!
Now!
Put them in the water. ln the water.
I just want the kid, Fitz.
Okay.
Well, I hope you brought what I want, otherwise I'm gonna have to kill him.
And I swear to you, I'll do it.
I believe you.
Just like Wichita.
-I understand.
-Okay.
I'm just gonna get the battery. -It's right here.
-Don't give it to him, Roy.
Please don't give it to him.
No, no. Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him.
Put it on the deck.
-Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him !
-Easy, easy. Simon, it's okay.
Roy, don't give it to him !
-Shut it! Stop it!
Shut it! -Roy!
Okay. Okay, I'll make another one. -You don't understand.
-Simon, don't talk. -I'll just make another one.
-Make another one?
Am I dying?
No, you fainted.
-I'm sorry.
-No, that's okay.
No, no.
I've been trying to tell you.. .
Why is it hot?
Because it's filled with power.
The battery.. . I messed up.
It's deteriorating. I know.
It's unstable.
You're a smart guy, Simon.
I know you'll figure it out.
Oh, my glasses. Thank you. Roy, you're shot.
Get help.
Roy. You're beautiful, June Havens.
Stay with me.
Roy, look at me. Stay with me.
We're here now, Miller.
We got you. We got you. -Charge at 360.
-June.
Clear! It's been a spectacular couple of weeks, Miller.
It's good to see you, lsabel.
Hi, guys.
You cleaned house, Roy.
I have to thank you for that.
I trusted the wrong man.
It happens.
Simon's happy.
He's got a new lab.
Where is June?
I sent her home.
She gets it.
She knows you two lead different lives and she's moving on.
As should you.
You gave up those things.
You let go of who you were. Family, friends, that's the deal.
Why are we still talking about this?
Because the agency invested a lot in you.
And you're an asset only as long as you stay focused.
You look good.
Get some rest.
We got to transfer you to a secure facility tomorrow. For your safety.
Nurse?
What.. .
What did you give me?
Brotine-zero.
Stay under there, Roy.
You're dead.
Make way, please.
Going to the mortuary.
Don't worry, Roy.
I got this.
It's time for a vacation.
Ride like the wind And I've got Such a long way to go To make it to the border of Mexico
Hey, there, sleepy head.
What day is it?
Someday.
Someday, Roy.
What am I wearing? A pair of shorts.
How did I get into shorts?
Roy, I've been trained to rebuild a six-speed transmission with nothing but a pair of pliers and a crescent wrench.
I think I can get you into a pair of shorts without looking. I'm not saying that's what I did.
You're both the navigator and the DJ.
And we have a long way to go to Cape Horn.
With me, without me.
With me, without me.
With you.
Put some tunes on the radio, Mr. DJ.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, my God, Frank. What is this envelope with tickets to Cape Horn?

Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com Thank you. Thank you, everybody.
To have exactly the body that you want. You just have to want... A shitty body.
I don't, though, like being those things all the time.
I get really sweaty all the time.
I-- and that's also bad for sex,
'cause I just sweat--
Uhhh !" And I always see her and she's like, just--
Just sweat is pouring off my head and she's like,
"dude, you're limiting my enjoyment by a lot."
N ) no.
Well, then you can call for an appointment.
Before they get here. Yes?
I'm here to see Ben, Dr. Mitchell.
Okay, what time is your appointment And what is your name?
My name's Louie c.K. And he said to be here around 2:00. "he said"?
The doctor doesn't make appointments. Oh, well, see, I know him. We-- I used to-- we went to high school together
And I talked to him on the phone.
He said that I could come by.
He didn't put your name in the book
And he didn't tell me, so you don't have an appointment.
Can you check with him? He's with a patient. Okay, well, I'll just wait and--
Sir, you don't have an appointment.
Yeah, no, I get that,
But can you just let me wait until he comes out and--
You can't just sit in here
Do people, like, come here and steal medical treatment?
Do they steal it from you?
And you will start feeling better very soon. Thanks, doctor.
No problem. Hey, Ben, how you doing?
You told me to come by, remember?
Do I know you?
Uh... Come through.
It's fine, Priscilla.
Hey, listen, I didn't mean to Jump ahead of that woman if she was waiting.
Don't worry, she's...
She's dying.
From her vagina up to her eyeballs.
So I'm just squeezing her for a little extra insurance money
Man, that's not funny.
Oh, God, how are you?
I'm, uh-- I feel like shit.
Feel like shit?
Are you sure you feel like shit and not diarrhea? 'cause you look like diarrhea. It looks like someone poured diarrhea Into a face-shaped mold.
Could you stop? 'cause I really am-- I'm worried.
I don't know what's up with me. Look up.
Okay.
I know what's wrong with you.
What? Aids.
I can't believe you're a doctor.
Strip down to your underpants.
Let's take a look at you.
Let's take a look at you.
Jesus.
That is-- you don't need a doctor,
You need a time machine.
Did no one tell you that tits Are meant to be on women, not men?
What is that?
Come on, man. This is a nightmare.
Get up here.
Oh, dear. Okay.
Take a deep breath and hold it. So how do you feel, really?
You're an asshole.
Strip all the way down.
How can-- that is...
Really bad.
That's the worst penis I've ever seen in my life.
That is disgusting.
It's--
Oh, my God. This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me,
Seeing that,
And my dad hung himself in front of me Whilst masturbating.
But if I could take one of those things back, It would be seeing that awful cock.
It looks like you've been getting a dog to suck it off,
But it chewed it like it thought it was
A horrible old blood-and-cum-filled shoe. Nurse, can you come here a minute? I'm serious.
That is the worst penis
Probably in the world. Nurse? Honestly, is that not the ugliest penis
You've ever seen in your life? Yes, doctor, it's very ugly.
Very ugly, very ugly. She's a nurse, so--
Stop it. Come on, man.
What worries me is, if that's your penis and testicles,
What's your anus gonna be like? But we're not gonna find that out.
We are gonna find out because I need to give you
A full rectal examination.
No, no, no way. Yes way.
You're over 40, Louie, okay?
No more wanking around. This could save your life. Okay, all right.
Come on.
Look, it's not very pleasant,
But it's necessary. Okay, all right. Okay, and I'll be as gentle as I can.
Yeah, it's okay. How about that?
Yeah, that's all right. What about this?
Jesus Christ! What? This is serious.
What's wrong with you? This is serious.
There's no way it's supposed to go in and out like that.
Well, it can do. I'm a doctor. Yeah!
And it tells me that everything is fine up there.
Jesus.
Listen, I'm still going with aids, But let's do some blood work and find out.
My days start poorly, 'cause of the shape I'm in.
Because now, also, I'm 42, so I'm getting-- I'm get-- I'm really on the decline.
There's never gonna be another year of my life
That was better than the year before. That's never gonna happen again!
I've seen my best years.
And when I wake up in the morning,
I just-- I'm-- I just sit there and I'm like,
"oh..."
It's an awful way to start your day. Every day starts with me, like, my eyes open
And I reload the program of misery.
I just open eyes,
Remember who I am,
What I'm like...
And I go, "ugh.
"I guess.
"I guess do it.
"I don't know.
I guess-- oh, my God."
Somebody called me an Indian giver recently.
I don't know if you've heard that expression
Since you were kids,
But I remember we used to call each other--
"Indian giver" is one of the most offensive things
You could ever-- because what it's meant to be Is that someone gave you something
And then they changed their minds. That makes you an Indian giver.
And we equate this to the indians
Because our feeling is that they gave us America,
And then they--
Well, they didn't take it back, certainly,
But they chang
Which is that we got here and the indians were like, "hi."
And we were like, "hey, can we have everything ?"
And they were like, "well, we don't know what 'have' means,
But enjoy all the things that you need, like we do."
So we start killing all of them.
And they were like, "oh, dude,
"could you not do that part where you kill all of us? 'cause that's kind of a drag for us."
And we're like, "you guys are Indian givers! "oh, my God! "we're gonna name that after you.
You guys are dicks !"
Anyway, thanks a lot, folks, good night.
We're gonna keep this show going,
We're gonna bring the next comic up.
Very funny guy, you guys might know him.
Nick DiPaolo.
Whoa!
How about a hand for the emcee, going through chemo, huh?
All right.
Poor prick-- skinny, no hair.
How are you?
Welcome to the basement of al-qaeda's hideout and...
You think I'm kidding?
Those aren't Irish guys making your falafel In the kitchen upstairs. How's it going?
I have two tables, all black people, So I know I'm not making no tips.
Are you being serious right now?
Yeah, look over there. I have two tables, they're all black. I'm working for free tonight.
Have you ever waited tables before? No.
Then shut up, asshole. I'm getting old.
This is how I know I'm getting old. I actually pulled a muscle in my neck
Giving my wife the finger behind her back. That's a true story.
We're having a fight, she walked out of the kitchen,
I went-- Ahh!
Like that.
Weird things are happening to my body as I get older.
Ever hold a piss so long it turns into a shit?
That didn't happen when I was in high school. .
Ooh, listen to that silence, huh?
Holy shit, I hit you right in
The "white guilt" muscle, didn't I?
I mean, can we quit calling Obama
The first black president?
My nipples are darker than Barack Obama.
They're so in love with this guy.
They want to give him his own national holiday, Barack? He hasn't even been shot yet.
Ooh...
This is perfect, they hate my guts.
All right.
People are such hypocrites down there.
I'm sure you did better at the Hitler youth rally.
Ha-ha, liberal fag.
Yeah, okay, himmler.
Why don't you just go eat out Obama's asshole? I would.
I mean, I'm not gay, but just to be part of history.
Country's going to shit.
You know, you Republicans are such babies.
You've had your way for eight years, Why can't you just give somebody else a try?
Because it's a bullshit sham, that's why. He's in there because of white guilt
And affirmative action.
And anybody who has the balls to say that out loud
Is called a nazi by deluded assholes like you.
Poor little nazis don't like being called nazis.
I'm sorry.
Nobody-- but now Obama's in there, no one can say shit. You know, if it's like you say it is And it's your turn, then how--
Why don't we get a say in it, like you did?
I mean, a white guy doesn't have a voice In this country anymore.
Are we supposed to feel sorry for white guys? What, is 10,000 years of unchecked prosperity,
That's not enough for you?
And then you can celebrate with a big parade of soldiers And have white columns with an eagle,
Maybe some red banners with a white circle
And have something like this going in the middle of it? The nazi thing again? Is that all you got?
Yeah, well, that's what-- it's the same thing-- What is it, what? It's one group--
Come up with a different argument. ...
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you? What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you? What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
You pretend you're kidding, but you really mean it. My father fought those nazis, okay?
You Hitler nazi piece of shit!
Come on.
Get off me! Get the ( bleep ) off me!
You cut my hand.
Goddamnit.
Nice.
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
How long they gonna make you wait?
I ink the guy they're working on now Has a musket wound.
Got blindsided by a model t.
I heard he got stepped on by a dinosaur.
Seeping germs into your wound.
I think I saw the bartender spit into it And wipe up some aids vomit.
God.
So how are the kids? Good. They're at my place.
Babysitter.
They'll be waking me up in about four hours.
Must be nice.
Oh, it's andie.
Hello, hey, babe. Yeah, no.
I'm out. Nothing.
Yeah, no, try to get some sleep.
All right, you too.
Bye.
You didn't tell her where you are?
She's gonna start worrying, what's the use?
I mean, I just think it's great that you and andie
Made it work, you know?
You've been together, what, 15 years?
Yeah, well, it ain't easy.
Well, at least you did it.
Miss your wife?
No, but I envy you.
The other day, I get a package in the mail, right?
It's from India. I'm like, what the hell's this shit?
So I open it up.
It's a brick of Viagra.
I look over at andie, she's grinning.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, she ordered on-line, you know.
I feel bad, she's lonely. She's gorgeous,
I don't want to be with anybody else,
But, you know, some nights...
I don't know.
I'd just rather have a burger and hit the sack.
Yeah, we started counseling And every other night
I stick a wooden medicated boner in her
And now just-- we sit around waiting to see Who's gonna die first. That's about it.
I mean, we're getting old, Lou.
I mean, we can't have kids anymore.
Um...
I don't know.
At one point, one of us is gonna leave the other behind.
Oh, jeez.
I guess this is where the letter "c"
Comes for her dialysis.
Sorry about your hand, man.
It's all right, I don't jerk off anymore
And I can lift the toilet seat with the other one.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I called you a nazi.
Hey, seriously, man. You got your kids, you're lucky.
I'm happy for you, really.
Thanks, Nick. Remember when we were in our 20s, We used to come home this late
'cause we were out getting laid?
We never got laid.
I remember one time I was with a friend of mine
Who lives in New York also, And we went to go pick up his cousin--
She lives on a farm in new Hampshire her whole life. Her family is this weird family that kept her kids on a farm.
Anyway, her parents finally died, so she got to leave,
And so she came down to visit her cousin,
My friend in the city,
And so we picked her up at port authority bus station.
She had never been to any city before And we're picking her up at the port authority,
That smelly hole of a place.
And we pick her up there and she's just freaking out
At New York. She's never seen anything like it.
And we pass this homeless guy and she sees him--
I mean, we all passed him, but she saw him.
She's the only one who actually saw him.
We didn't-- me and her cousin were like, "so? "he's supposed to be there. "so what? "there's a perfectly good reason why that's not me and it's him.
The right people always win, I'm sure of it."
But, so there he is,
And this dude was particularly homeless.
He was one of those high-octane homeless,
Smelly, just piss smell,
The unbelievable piss smell, just--
He was piss.
He didn't just smell like piss, he was-- When you piss, he comes out.
That's what-- that's how much...
Or folks just went, "ek," all day.
And he had dreadlocks.
Not hacky sack, cool-guy, medical-marijuana dreadlocks,
Just "human-neglect clumps" of hair.
That no one knew his name or cared.
Yeah, that's who you've been laughing at
For the last ten minutes.
That's how bad it was.
And again, me and my friend were just like, "hmph."
His cousin immediately just gets--
She takes a knee. That's how-- I mean, I'm not even taking a real knee now,
That's how little I give a shit about the guy.
He's not even here and I'm still like,
"hmph, yeah, that's close enough."
She goes, "oh, my God, sir, are you okay?
What happened ?" "what happened ?"
What do you mean, "what happened ?"
So she's down there-- "sir, can we call someone ?" And me and my friend, we're from New York,
This is the crazy part, we immediately go to her, "oh, no, no, no, honey, don't..."
We start correcting her behavior
Like she's doing something wrong. She's like, "why, is he okay ?" "no, no, he needs you desperately,
"that's not the point. "we just don't do that here.
You silly country girl."
Hello?
Louie? Hi, it's doctor Ben.
Hey, what's up man? Yeah, yeah, how are you?
Um... Look... I got back your blood work.
Yeah?
Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry about being an arse...
By the way, um... Te thing is I need you to come back here to do some more tests.
What... What for?
Well, your blood work shows... that... you may have... slight... big fat... gingi-ugly-itis...
Oh, my God, you're such a dick.
No, um, you've got AlDS.
That's why I thought I need prove, but don't worry, the cancer is gonna eventually kill the AlDS before... it kills you quite slowly and... and painfully.
Loads of it. In your scrotum. Um, in fact, that's all there is in the scrotum.
No balls at all, just two healthy lumps of cancer replaced the horrible *** bollocks in there.
By the way, the AlDS shows um, this very... extensive shows that you... got the AlDS from raping a little blind boy...
Louie...
